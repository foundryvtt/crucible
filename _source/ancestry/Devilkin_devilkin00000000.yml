  description: >-
    You were born with unexpected magical influence over your creation. Your
    physical appearance shows tell-tale signs that the superstitious associate
    with planar beings- crimson flesh, ineffective wings or horns, reptilian
    eyes. Your dislike of light and preternatural resistance to fire does little
    to dissuade people from thinking you are an actual devil.
