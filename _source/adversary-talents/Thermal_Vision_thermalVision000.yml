  description: >-
    <p>The @ref[actor.name]{Creature} perceives the world through differences in
    temperature with precision, allowing it to locate creatures which are
    warm-blooded or otherwise emit heat up to 60 feet away as long as they are
    not behind total cover and you are not Blinded or Incapacitated. A creature
    detected using this Thermal Vision is treated as visible for the purposes of
    actions which require you to see your target.</p><p></p>
