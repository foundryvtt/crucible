    <p>The @ref[actor.name]{creature}'s life is sustained by necromantic magic
    or otherworldly forces. When it would be considered @Condition[dead]  it is
    instead @Condition[incapacitated].</p><p>After the conclusion of combat, the
    @ref[actor.name]{creature} may begin to perform the Recover action,
    regaining consciousness after the recovery is complete. Recovery in this
    fashion may be prevented in one of the following ways:</p><ul><li><p>The
    creature was incapacitated by a type of damage for which it is
    <strong>Vulnerable</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The magical forces which caused
    it to rise as undead are disrupted, countered, or otherwise
    dispelled.</p></li><li><p>The creature's body is destroyed to a degree that
    it can no longer maintain its physical form.</p></li></ul>
