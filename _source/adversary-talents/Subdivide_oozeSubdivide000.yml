        <p>The ooze's cells rapidly divide and the creature splits in two! The
        original creature and its clone equally divide its remaining
        <strong>Health</strong>. The <strong>Size</strong> of each resulting
        creature is decreased by 1.</p><p>If in combat, the new creature acts as
        a <strong>Summon</strong> and joins at <strong>Initiative</strong> 1.
        This Action may only be used if the creature has Size larger than 2. The
