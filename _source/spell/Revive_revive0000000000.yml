  description: >-
    <p>A potent expression of Life and Control magics, Revive allows the caster
    to intervene in the natural process of death by driving a surge of the
    essence of life into the body of the recently deceased. Those who have
    experienced Revival are often reluctant to discuss it, but describe it as a
    sensation that is unpleasantly reminiscent of being woken suddenly from a
    deep slumber to find they have been freezing— the flesh prickles and aches,
    the mind reels, and the soul aches with the memory of its interrupted
    departure.</p>
