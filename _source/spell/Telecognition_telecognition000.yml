  description: >-
    <p>A rudimentary example of the complex art of penetrating the minds of
    others, Telecognition skims thoughts from the surface of a subject's mind
    like leaves from the surface of a pond. Though it may not be disruptive, it
    is unsubtle— just as the pond ripples when its surface is touched, so too
    does the mind.</p><p></p>

      description: >-
        <p>You reach into the mind of a <strong>Humanoid</strong> or
        <strong>Giant</strong> creature, attempting to penetrate their
        <strong>Willpower</strong> defense to understand their thoughts and
        motives. The target of this spell is aware of the intrusion, even if
        they cannot perceive you.</p><p>If successful, the Gamemaster (in the
        case of an Adversary target) or Player (in the case of a Hero target)
        must describe to you in 3 words or less what idea or sentiment is at the
        forefront of their thoughts in the current moment.</p><p>Upon a Critical
        Success, this description may use up to 10 words to convey deeper
        understanding.</p>
