      description: >-
        <p>You create a pillar of magical light centered upon your current
        position which creates a cylinder of light creating 30 feet of bright
        light and an additional 30 feet of dim light. The pillar remains in
        place for 6 rounds or until dispelled.</p><p>This magical light
        counteracts magical darkness and destroys any source of magical darkness
        whose origin is contained within its area.</p><p>Enemies within the area
        when the light is first created must resist an attack against their
        <strong>Fortitude</strong> or be @Condition[blinded] for one
        round.</p><p><strong>WIP: This spell does not yet automatically create a
        light source, which must be done manually for now. Eventually this will
        be automated using a new Foundry VTT version 14 framework for template
        placement.</strong></p>
