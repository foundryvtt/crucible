      description: >-
        <p>You create a sphere of magical darkness around your current position
        with 20 foot radius which remains in place for 6 rounds or until
        dispelled.</p><p>Within the area of this darkness all non-magical light
        sources are quenched and creatures are treated as
        @Condition[blinded].</p><p>The area of this sphere is constrained by
        solid walls. Creatures outside this area cannot see into it and the
        effective area of light sources outside this area ends at its
        perimeter.</p><p><strong>WIP: This spell does not yet automatically
        create a darkness source, which must be done manually for now.
        Eventually this will be automated using a new Foundry VTT version 14
        framework for template placement.</strong></p>
