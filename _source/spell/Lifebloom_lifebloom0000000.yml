    <p>Few are those that can serve as a conduit within the physical world and
    allow the raw powers of Life and Soul to comingle, tipping the balance in
    their favour. This spell allows the caster to serve as a wellspring for the
    abundant forces that bring all soulful life into being. With a susurration
    of air the caster is surrounded with dancing motes of the pure energies of
    life and soul, like dozens of fireflies or the sparks from a fire, and a
    those within the radius are filled with a calming sensation as if they were
    immersed in pleasantly warm water. All plant life in the vicinity
    immediately surges through stages of growth to bloom, and the scent of
    pollen and lush greenery fills the air.</p>
