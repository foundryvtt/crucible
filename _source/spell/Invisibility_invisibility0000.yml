    <p>A sophisticated use of Illusory magic, the Invisibility spell allows the
    caster to wrap light and shadow around themselves like donning a cloak,
    reflecting the world about them as if they were not standing there. What
    person wouldn't believe it when their own eyes tell them that there is
    nothing to see?</p>
