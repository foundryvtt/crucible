    <p>Yours has been an itinerant life. You enjoy nothing more than the feeling
    of a cart or mount below you, watching some foreign sky slowly pass above
    you. You learned to pay careful attention to your surroundings and their
    needs, to tend the creatures on which you rely, and to make do with what you
    can find.</p>
