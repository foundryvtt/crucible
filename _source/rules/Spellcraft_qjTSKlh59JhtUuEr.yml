        <p><strong>Spellcraft</strong> is the particular art and theory of magic
        as implemented in the Crucible system. Proficiecy with spellcraft
        advances through Talents that are learned as part of character
        progression. The Crucible spellcraft system is designed to be dynamic
        and generative, allowing players who wish to focus their character on
        spellcasting to improvise and discover effective combinations and
        applications for their magical abilities.</p><section
        class="construction"><p>The Spellcraft system is still a
        work-in-progress and, while functional, is expected to undergo
        substantial revision and iteration in future Crucible releases. The
        implementation of the Spellcraft system in Playtest One should provide
        insight into its mechanics and planned functionality.</p></section><h2
        class="divider">Masterful Composition</h2><p>Spellcraft allows
        characters to manifest magic by composing a spell using a
        @UUID[.p3hKRiZN3x0DEtyG]{Rune}, @UUID[.lhrYInsQ2f0YfhTu]{Gesture}, and
        optionally an
        @UUID[.ELOcfx6LPZMh74y8]{Inflection}.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Runes</strong>
        represent the base magical essence (such as Spirit or Flame),
        metaphysical concepts that combine to form the laws of
        reality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gestures</strong> represent the forming
        of the rune into a spell, using physical motion as a somatic component
        which shape (such as Create or Arrow) a Rune's power, causing it to act
        in a specific way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inflections</strong> represent
        a further change or modification (such as Quicken or Pull), and use
        vocalization to alter how a spell is formed.</p></li></ul><p>As your
        character learns Talents which provide Spellcraft components, these
        components will appear on the Grimoire tab of your character sheet and
        become usable through the <strong>Cast a Spell</strong> action. The
        process of learning components and discovering new spell combinations is
        intended to provide a rewarding experience of magical experimentation
        and narrative development for characters which invest into
        Spellcraft.</p><p>It is useful to think of the rules and structure of
        the Spellcraft system linguistically. If you think of a spell as a
        sentence, each spell must have a Rune (noun) and a Gesture (verb), and
        may optionally include an Inflection (adjective/adverb) that modifies
        either.</p><p>Spells which attack an opponent follow the rules of
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c.JournalEntryPage.lZfPVvBSsCEqlte4]{Attack
        Rolls}, with changes to the Ability Bonus and Base Damage of the attack
        depending on the combination of Rune and Gesture used.</p><section
        class="gameplay"><h4>Example: Zarajah the Pyromancer</h4><p>Zarajah is
        an ambitious Level 6 sorcerer who strives to master the arts of
        elemental magic. Zarajah knows the runes for <strong>Flame</strong>,
        <strong>Kinesis</strong>, and <strong>Lightning</strong> as well as
        gestures for <strong>Touch</strong> (automatically learned),
        <strong>Influence</strong>, and <strong>Arrow</strong>. Additionally,
        Zarajah has also learned the <strong>Quicken</strong> inflection. Using
        these components, Zarajah has access to 18 different combinations which
        form Spells.</p><p>Zarajah's favorite spell is <strong>Quickened Arrow
        of Flame</strong> which allows her to hurl a projectile of arcane fire
        at a single target up to 10 spaces distant at the cost of <strong>1
        Action</strong> and <strong>2 Focus</strong> points. The Flame rune
        targets <strong>Reflex</strong> defense and deals <strong>Fire
        Damage</strong> to <strong>Health</strong>. Arrow and Flame both scale
        using <strong>Intellect</strong>, so the effectiveness of this spell
        scales using only Intellect as a single ability score.</p><p>When
        Zarajah casts a <strong>Quickened Arrow of Flame</strong> towards a
        swooping Manticore, she rolls a <strong>28</strong> on her spell attack
        roll, beating the Manticore's Reflex defense of <strong>21</strong>.
        This <strong>7 Overflow Damage</strong> is increased by the <strong>10
        Base Damage</strong> of the Arrow gesture, resulting in a total of
        <strong>17 Fire Damage</strong> dealt to the foe.</p><p>Since this
        attack is also a Critical Hit, the Manticore bursts into flame due to
        Zarajah's <strong>Pyromancer</strong> talent which inflicts the
        <strong>Burning</strong> condition causing additional
        damage-over-time.</p></section><h2>The Cost of Magic</h2><p>Every magic
        spell has a cost- whether used within a combat situation or for
        out-of-combat benefits. Generally, this cost is paid in the form of
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6.JournalEntryPage.FmmADsI9qo1uIIT3#capacity-for-action]{Focus
        Points}, though in some situations the cost may use other resources or
        have other requirements.</p><p>As you construct your spells, the cost of
        the spell in Action Points and Focus Points may change based on your
        choice of @UUID[.p3hKRiZN3x0DEtyG]{Rune},
        @UUID[.lhrYInsQ2f0YfhTu]{Gesture} and
        @UUID[.ELOcfx6LPZMh74y8]{Inflection}.</p>

        <p>Runes are the most basic metaphysical concept of magic. They are
        forces of nature, the building blocks of reality as we understand it.
        Understanding the Runes and their place in the way the world functions
        allows those with sufficient training to exert a level of influence over
        the Runes, using @UUID[.lhrYInsQ2f0YfhTu]{Gestures} to manifest powerful
        displays of magical prowess.</p><p>There are six Chaotic Runes and six
        Orderly Runes, forming a natural opposition to one another. Lesser Runes
        which are more closely associated with tangible, elemental forces (such
        as Flame and Frost, Life and Death), and Greater Runes which represent
        more abstract forces (such as Control and Spirit, Kinesis and
        Stasis).</p><h2 class="divider">Chaotic Runes</h2><p><strong>Lesser
        Runes</strong></p><ul><li><p>Flame - The chaotic force of elemental,
        thermal energy. The Flame rune governs fire and heat. It is opposed by
        the orderly rune of Frost.</p></li><li><p>Life - The chaotic force of
        creation, responsible for all living matter. The Life rune governs
        health and matters relating to biological growth. It is opposed by the
        orderly rune of Death.</p></li><li><p>Lightning - The chaotic force of
        raw, electrical energy. The Lightning rune governs sources of electrical
        energy and electrical discharge. It is opposed by the orderly rune of
        Earth.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Greater
        Runes</strong></p><ul><li><p>Illumination - The chaotic force of light
        and positive energy. The Illumination rune governs light and all of its
        properties. It is opposed by the orderly rune of
        Shadow.</p></li><li><p>Spirit - The chaotic force of emotion and
        willfulness. The Spirit rune governs matters related to emotional
        well-being as well as the soul. It is opposed by the orderly rune of
        Control.</p></li><li><p>Kinesis - The chaotic force of space and
        physical movement. The Kinesis rune governs all things related to the
        act of movement and physicality. It is opposed by the orderly rune of
        Stasis.</p></li></ul><h2 class="divider">Orderly
        Runes</h2><p><strong>Lesser Runes</strong></p><ul><li><p>Death - The
        orderly force of destruction, responsible for the decay of all matter.
        The Death rune governs decay and destruction. It is opposed by the
        chaotic rune of Life.</p></li><li><p>Earth - The orderly force of
        elemental earth, responsible for physical matter. The Earth rune governs
        health and matters relating to biological growth. It is opposed by the

        <p>Gestures are the physical, somatic components required to invoke a
        rune for Spellcraft purposes. Gestures determine the shape a spell will
        take as it is translated from the raw magical energies governed by a
        Rune into a manifestation of that power. Gestures set particular
        properties of a magical spell, usually the cost in Action and Focus
        points, range (or size), targeting type, and shape. Gestures also
        determine one-half of the scaling damage formula, with Rune as the other
        half.</p><h2>Arrow</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 2 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Hurl
        a projectile of magical power at a distant target. This might use the
        Lightning Rune to hurl a lightning bolt, or the Shadow rune to hurl a
        ball of devouring darkness.</p><h2>Aspect</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 2 Action, 1
        Focus</em></p><p>Infuse the essence of a Rune into the self, empowering
        the physical form or psyche.</p><p>When you assume a certain Aspect, you
        become more closely attuned to the damage type of the Rune used in your
        spell. You gain <strong>+2 Resistance</strong> to that damage type, and
        deal an additional <strong>+2 Damage</strong> whenever dealing damage of
        that type.</p><h2>Create</h2><p><em>2 Hands, 2 Action, 1
        Focus</em></p><p>Coalesce arcane power into tangible form, conjuring a
        <strong>Creation</strong> which appears in an adjacent space and joins
        Combat at Initiative 1.</p><p>Your Creation is a Minion of half your own
        Level chosen from the Summoned Creatures compendium pack corresponding
        to the Rune used in the spell.</p><h2>Fan</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 2 Action, 1
        Focus</em></p><p>Focus the essence of a rune into a sweeping or
        splintered arc to strike multiple targets in close proximity. If used
        with Earth, this might hurl a spray of stone in an arc, while using it
        with Kinesis might carve a slice across multiple
        foes.</p><h2>Influence</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 2 Action, 1
        Focus</em></p><p>Channel concentrated arcane energy through a single
        target via touch. If used with the rune of Life this would create a
        powerful healing effect, while used with the touch of Lightning would
        provide a powerful jolt of Electrical damage.</p><h2>Pulse</h2><p><em>2
        Hands, 2 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Emit a burst of Runic power in a
        circular wave that travels outward, with you at its center. A Pulse of
        Spirit might be used to bolster Morale for your allies, while a Death
        pulse might be used to deal Corruption damage to a group of enemies
        gathered around you.</p><h2>Ray</h2><p><em>1 Hand, 2 Action, 1
        Focus</em></p><p>Focus the power of a Rune into a single point,
        expelling its energy into a ranged beam which rapidly travels a short
        distance to a targeted area. If used with Life this might restore the HP
        of a distant ally steadily over time, while Frost might emit a beam that
        freezes a target in place.</p><h2>Step</h2><p><em>0 Hands , 1 Action, 1
        Focus</em></p><p>Infuse runic power into a movement, crossing physical
        and spatial boundaries. Move 4 spaces in a straight line, dealing minor
        damage to enemies or applying restoration to allies in your
        path.</p><h2>Strike</h2><p><em>0 Hands, 2 Action, 1
        Focus</em></p><p>Empower a close-range attack with the essence of a
        Rune. This rune performs a melee weapon attack targeting the defense and
        dealing damage of the Rune used in the spell.</p><h2>Touch</h2><p><em>1
        Hand, 1 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Manifest the power of a Rune to pass
        its essence through physical contact. Used with Death this might deal
        damage to a target within arm's reach, while using it with Control might
        cause the target you touch to do your bidding.</p><h2>Ward</h2><p><em>1
        Hand, 1 Action, 1 Focus</em></p><p>Focus the power of a Rune into a
        protective barrier, shielding yourselves and others from harmful
        effects. When used with the Kinesis rune the Ward reduces incoming
        damage from a chosen physical damage type while combination with the
        Death rune protects against Corruption damage.</p>

        <p>Inflections are optional verbal components that modify spell effects,
        often amplifying or substituting certain properties a spell may have.
        Inflections can alter nearly any property that a Rune or Gesture
        provides to a spell, and may have additional effects on the spell's
        purpose.</p><section class="construction"><p>While some inflections have
        been implemented for Playtest 1, more Inflections are intended for
        future phases. Some of the Inflections listed below may not be fully
        implemented or automated at this
        time.</p></section><h2>Compose</h2><p><em><strong>(+1 Action, -1
        Focus)</strong></em></p><p>Enhance a spell by taking extra time in its
        formation, reducing other resource costs in exchange. The Compose
        inflection reduces the <strong>Focus</strong> cost of a spell by 1 while
        increasing its <strong>Action</strong> cost by 1 in
        exchange.</p><h2>Determine</h2><p><em><strong>(+1
        Focus)</strong></em></p><p>Enhance a spell to make it more difficult to
        counter. Any attempt to Counter-Spell this spell is made with +2
        Banes.</p><h2>Extend</h2><p><em><strong>(+1 Action, +1
        Focus)</strong></em></p><p>Enhance the duration of a spell, increasing
        the duration of its effect. For spells which are instantaneous, any
        corresponding status conditions that they cause are increased in
        duration.</p><section class="construction"><p>Effect duration increases
        from the Extend inflection are not yet automated in Playtest 1. This
        inflection is included as an example of the intended direction for the
        Spellcraft system.</p></section><h2>Elude</h2><p><em><strong>(+1
        Focus)</strong></em></p><p>Enhance a spell to make it more difficult for
        an enemy to retaliate against its casting. This spell does not provide
        any opportunity to make reactions that involve Strike attacks,
        regardless of the results of the
        spell.</p><h2>Negate</h2><p><em><strong>(+1
        Focus)</strong></em></p><p>Invert the effect of a spell. An Inverted
        Life Touch spell which normally heals a target deals Poison damage
        instead. An Inverted Death Ward spell inflicts vulnerability to
        Corruption damage upon an adjacent enemy.</p><section

        system.</p></section><h2>Pull</h2><p><em><strong>(+1

        <p>In addition to Composed Spells, investment into spellcraft talents
        unlocks Iconic Spell slots which provide a limited number of special
        spells which you know. These Iconic Spells have specialized effects
        which are not otherwise possible via the Composed Spell system and cover
        the breadth of magical capability that a system like Crucible
        requires.</p><h2 class="divider">Learning Iconic Spells</h2><p>Each
        character has a certain number of Iconic Spell slots — initially zero.
        When learning certain spellcraft talents, you will gain an additional
        Iconic Spell slot which can then be populated with an Iconic Spell
        provided you possess the prerequisite knowledge to learn it.</p><h2
        class="divider">Replacing Iconic Spells</h2><p>When your character
        advances in level you may — if you wish — remove one known Iconic Spell
        from your repetoire, freeing that spell slot to be filled with an
        alternative Iconic Spell.</p>

        <p>Countermagic is the art of magical defence, weaving opposing
        spellcraft to negate the spell being cast by an opponent. Constructing a
        proper counterspell requires a degree of magical knowledge and an
        ability to process that knowledge in an asymmetric way, as you may not
        always have all the information needed to build your opposition
        correctly. Someone with a deep understanding of magic may be able to
        easily identify the telltale signs of specific Runes being used,
        identify a gesture, or interpret an inflection and glean the purpose of
        a spell. Someone practiced in Countermagic may find unique ways to
        disrupt a spell being cast, including sapping the magical energies from
        it at inception.</p><section class="construction"><p>The Counterspell
        sub-system has not been included in this playtest.</p></section>
