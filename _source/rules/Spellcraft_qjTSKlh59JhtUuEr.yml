        <p><strong>Spellcraft</strong> is the particular art and theory of magic
        as implemented in the Crucible system. Proficiecy with spellcraft
        advances through Talents that are learned as part of character
        progression. The Crucible spellcraft system is designed to be dynamic
        and generative, allowing players who wish to focus their character on
        spellcasting to improvise and discover effective combinations and
        applications for their magical abilities.</p><section
        class="construction"><p>The Spellcraft system is still a
        work-in-progress and, while functional, is expected to undergo
        substantial revision and iteration in future Crucible releases. The
        implementation of the Spellcraft system in Playtest One should provide
        insight into its mechanics and planned functionality.</p></section><h2
        class="divider">Masterful Composition</h2><p>Spellcraft allows
        characters to manifest magic by composing a spell using a
        @UUID[.p3hKRiZN3x0DEtyG]{Rune}, @UUID[.lhrYInsQ2f0YfhTu]{Gesture}, and
        optionally an
        @UUID[.ELOcfx6LPZMh74y8]{Inflection}.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Runes</strong>
        represent the base magical essence (such as Spirit or Flame),
        metaphysical concepts that combine to form the laws of
        reality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gestures</strong> represent the forming
        of the rune into a spell, using physical motion as a somatic component
        which shape (such as Create or Arrow) a Rune's power, causing it to act
        in a specific way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inflections</strong> represent
        a further change or modification (such as Quicken or Pull), and use
        vocalization to alter how a spell is formed.</p></li></ul><p>As your
        character learns Talents which provide Spellcraft components, these
        components will appear on the Grimoire tab of your character sheet and
        become usable through the <strong>Cast a Spell</strong> action. The
        process of learning components and discovering new spell combinations is
        intended to provide a rewarding experience of magical experimentation
        and narrative development for characters which invest into
        Spellcraft.</p><p>It is useful to think of the rules and structure of
        the Spellcraft system linguistically. If you think of a spell as a
        sentence, each spell must have a Rune (noun) and a Gesture (verb), and
        may optionally include an Inflection (adjective/adverb) that modifies
        either.</p><p>Spells which attack an opponent follow the rules of
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c.JournalEntryPage.lZfPVvBSsCEqlte4]{Attack
        Rolls}, with changes to the Ability Bonus and Base Damage of the attack
        depending on the combination of Rune and Gesture used.</p><section
        class="gameplay"><h4>Example: Zarajah the Pyromancer</h4><p>Zarajah is
        an ambitious Level 6 sorcerer who strives to master the arts of
        elemental magic. Zarajah knows the runes for <strong>Flame</strong>,
        <strong>Kinesis</strong>, and <strong>Lightning</strong> as well as
        gestures for <strong>Touch</strong> (automatically learned),
        <strong>Influence</strong>, and <strong>Arrow</strong>. Additionally,
        Zarajah has also learned the <strong>Quicken</strong> inflection. Using
        these components, Zarajah has access to 18 different combinations which
        form Spells.</p><p>Zarajah's favorite spell is <strong>Quickened Arrow
        of Flame</strong> which allows her to hurl a projectile of arcane fire
        at a single target up to 10 spaces distant at the cost of <strong>1
        Action</strong> and <strong>2 Focus</strong> points. The Flame rune
        targets <strong>Reflex</strong> defense and deals <strong>Fire
        Damage</strong> to <strong>Health</strong>. Arrow and Flame both scale
        using <strong>Intellect</strong>, so the effectiveness of this spell
        scales using only Intellect as a single ability score.</p><p>When
        Zarajah casts a <strong>Quickened Arrow of Flame</strong> towards a
        swooping Manticore, she rolls a <strong>28</strong> on her spell attack
        roll, beating the Manticore's Reflex defense of <strong>21</strong>.
        This <strong>7 Overflow Damage</strong> is increased by the <strong>10
        Base Damage</strong> of the Arrow gesture, resulting in a total of
        <strong>17 Fire Damage</strong> dealt to the foe.</p><p>Since this
        attack is also a Critical Hit, the Manticore bursts into flame due to
        Zarajah's <strong>Pyromancer</strong> talent which inflicts the
        <strong>Burning</strong> condition causing additional
        damage-over-time.</p></section><h2>The Cost of Magic</h2><p>Every magic
        spell has a cost- whether used within a combat situation or for
        out-of-combat benefits. Generally, this cost is paid in the form of
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6.JournalEntryPage.FmmADsI9qo1uIIT3#capacity-for-action]{Focus
        Points}, though in some situations the cost may use other resources or
        have other requirements.</p><p>As you construct your spells, the cost of
        the spell in Action Points and Focus Points may change based on your
        choice of @UUID[.p3hKRiZN3x0DEtyG]{Rune},
        @UUID[.lhrYInsQ2f0YfhTu]{Gesture} and
        @UUID[.ELOcfx6LPZMh74y8]{Inflection}.</p>

        <p>Runes are the most basic metaphysical concept of magic. They are
        forces of nature, the building blocks of reality as we understand it.
        Understanding the Runes and their place in the way the world functions
        allows those with sufficient training to exert a level of influence over
        the Runes, using @UUID[.lhrYInsQ2f0YfhTu]{Gestures} to manifest powerful
        displays of magical prowess.</p><p>There are six Chaotic Runes and six

        <p>Gestures are the physical, somatic components required to invoke a
        rune for Spellcraft purposes. Gestures determine the shape a spell will
        take as it is translated from the raw magical energies governed by a
        Rune into a manifestation of that power. Gestures set particular
        properties of a magical spell, usually the cost in Action and Focus
        points, range (or size), targeting type, and shape. Gestures also
        determine one-half of the scaling damage formula, with Rune as the other
        half.</p><h2 class="divider">Starting Gesture</h2><p>Any spellcaster who
        knows any Rune automatically has access to the Touch gesture which
        provides a basic capability to use that Rune. More advanced usages of
        that Rune require incorporating more advanced
        Gestures.</p><dl><dt><p>Touch</p></dt><dd><p>You empower the arcane
        energy of a Rune into a hand-to-hand attack. The Touch gesture scales
        using <strong>Dexterity</strong> and targets a single creature at a
        range of 1 foot, dealing <strong>6 Base Damage</strong> to targets which
        fail to Resist the spell. This gesture requires <strong>1 Hand</strong>
        to cast and has a base cost of <strong>2 Action</strong> and <strong>1
        Focus</strong>.</p></dd></dl><h2 class="divider">Tier 1
        Gestures</h2><p>Tier 1 gestures (character levels 1-5) provide
        wide-ranging fundamentals of spellcraft composition that allows shaping
        Runes into a variety of offensive or defensive
        forms.</p><dl><dt><p>Arrow</p></dt><dd><p>You hurl a projectile imbued
        with the magical power of a Rune at a distant target. The Arrow gesture
        scales using <strong>Intellect</strong> and targets a single creature up
        to a distance of 60 feet, dealing <strong>8 Base Damage</strong> to
        targets which fail to Resist the spell. This gesture requires <strong>1
        Hand</strong> to cast and has a base cost of <strong>3 Action</strong>
        and <strong>1
        Focus</strong>.</p></dd></dl><dl><dt><p>Aspect</p></dt><dd><p>You infuse
        the essence of a Rune into your body, empowering your own physical form
        or psyche. When you assume a certain Aspect, you become more closely
        attuned to the damage type of the Rune used in your spell. You gain
        <strong>+2 Resistance</strong> to that damage type, and deal an
        additional <strong>+2 Damage</strong> whenever dealing damage of that
        type. Your Aspect lasts for <strong>6 Rounds</strong>. You may only have
        one active Aspect, casting another spell using the Aspect gesture
        replaces the previous effect. This gesture requires <strong>1
        Hand</strong> to cast and has a base cost of <strong>2 Action</strong>
        and <strong>1 Focus</strong>.</p></dd><dt><p>Create</p></dt><dd><p>You
        coalesce arcane power into tangible form, manifesting a
        <strong>Sprite</strong> which appears within 10 feet and joins Combat at
        Initiative 1. Your Sprite is a <strong>Minion</strong> of half your own
        Level. The Create gesture scales with <strong>Wisdom</strong> and the
        Sprite survives for <strong>6 Rounds</strong>. You may only have one
        active Sprite, casting another spell using the Create gesture replaces
        your previous Sprite. This gesture requires <strong>2 Hands</strong> to
        cast and has a base cost of <strong>4 Action</strong> and <strong>1
        Focus</strong>.</p></dd><dt><p>Fan</p></dt><dd><p>You shape the essence
        of a Rune into a sweeping or splintered arc to strike multiple targets
        in close proximity. The Fan gesture scales using
        <strong>Intellect</strong> and targets a 120 degree arc with 6 foot
        radius. It deals <strong>6 Base Damage</strong> to targets which fail to
        Resist the spell. This gesture requires <strong>1 Hand</strong> to cast
        and has a base cost of <strong>3 Action</strong> and <strong>1
        Focus</strong>.</p></dd><dt><p>Influence</p></dt><dd><p>You intensify
        the arcane power of a Rune into a concentrated direct contact which is
        generally a more powerful evolution of the basic Touch gesture. The
        Influence gesture scales using <strong>Presence</strong> and targets a
        single adjacent creature. It deals <strong>10 Base Damage</strong> to
        targets which fail to Resist the spell. This gesture requires <strong>1
        Hand</strong> to cast and has a base cost of <strong>3 Action</strong>
        and <strong>1 Focus</strong>.</p></dd><dt><p>Ray</p></dt><dd><p>You
        funnel the arcane power of a Rune into a point and project it outwards
        in a beam. The Ray gesture scales using <strong>Wisdom</strong> and
        produces a line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long originating from
        the spellcaster, dealing <strong>6 Base Damage</strong> to targets which
        fail to Resist the spell. The gesture requires <strong>1 Hand</strong>
        to cast and has a base cost of <strong>4 Action</strong> and <strong>1
        Focus</strong>.</p></dd><dt><p>Sense</p></dt><dd><p>You attune your mind
        to the arcane power of a Rune to sense nearby sources of energy. The
        Sense gesture scales with <strong>Presence</strong> and produces an
        emanation with 30 feet radius and position that remains centered upon
        the spellcaster. This gesture requires <strong>1 Hand</strong> to cast

        power into a movement, crossing physical and spatial boundaries. The
        Step gesture scales with <strong>Dexterity</strong> and allows you to
        move up to 20 feet in a straight line with width equal to your
        <strong>Size</strong>. It deals <strong>2 Base Damage</strong> to
        targets along that line which fail to Resist the spell. This gesture
        does not require any free hands to cast and has a base cost of <strong>3
        Action</strong> and <strong>1
        Focus</strong>.</p></dd><dt><p>Strike</p></dt><dd><p>You empower a
        direct close-range attack with the arcane essence of a Rune, performing
        a Strike with your equipped weapon. The Strike gesture scales using
        <strong>Strength</strong> and deal damage based on your used weapon but
        with the damage type of the incorporated Rune. This gesture does not
        require any free hand and has a base cost of <strong>1 Focus</strong> in
        addition to the cost of your weapon
        Strike.</p></dd><dt><p>Ward</p></dt><dd><p>You shape the arcane power of
        a Rune into a protective barrier used to shield yourself from harm. The
        Ward gesture scales using <strong>Toughness</strong> and provides
        <strong>+6 Resistance</strong> against the damage type of the Rune used
        in the spell. This resistance lasts for <strong>1 Round</strong> and you
        may only have a single Ward at a time. Casting another spell using the
        Ward gesture replaces your prior Ward. This gesture requires <strong>1
        Hand</strong> to cast and has a base cost of <strong>2 Action</strong>
        and <strong>1 Focus</strong>.</p></dd><h2 class="divider">Tier 2
        Gestures</h2><p>Tier 2 gestures (character levels 6-11) provide advanced
        capabilities that improve or expand upon fundamental Tier 1
        gestures.</p></dl><dl><dt><p>Aura</p></dt><dd><p>You concentrate the
        arcane power of a Rune to create a maintained field of energy that
        washes over allies and enemies near to you. The Aura gesture scales with
        <strong>Presence</strong> and produces an emanation with 20 feet radius
        centered on the spellcaster. The center of this Aura moves with the
        spellcaster. Depending on the Rune used, the Aura deals damage or
        provides healing to any creature which begins its turn inside the Aura.
        This gesture requires <strong>2 Hands</strong> to cast, has a base cost
        of <strong>5 Action</strong> and <strong>1 Focus</strong>, and must be
        <strong>Maintained</strong> costing an additional <strong>1
        Focus</strong> every subsequent
        round.</p></dd><dt><p>Blast</p></dt><dd><p>You hurl the arcane power of
        a Rune into an intense explosion of energy at a nearby point you can
        see. The Blast gesture scales with <strong>Intellect</strong> and
        produces a blast with 6 feet radius centered on a point within 60 feet
        of the spellcaster. The blast deals <strong>8 Base Damage</strong> to
        targets which fail to Resist the spell. This gesture requires <strong>2
        Hands</strong> to cast and has a base cost of <strong>5 Action</strong>
        and <strong>2 Focus</strong>.</p></dd><dt><p>Cone</p></dt><dd><p>You
        focus the arcane power of a Rune into a narrow cone that projects
        outwards from your location. The Cone gesture scales with
        <strong>Intellect</strong> and produces a 60 degree cone with a 30 foot
        radius originating from the spellcaster. The Cone deals <strong>8 Base
        Damage</strong> to targets which fail to Resist the spell. This gesture
        requires <strong>2 Hands</strong> to cast and has a base cost of
        <strong>5 Action</strong> and <strong>2
        Focus</strong>.</p></dd><dt><p>Conjure</p></dt><dd><p>You coalesce
        arcane power into a superior form, manifesting a
        <strong>Visitor</strong> which appears within 30 feet and joins Combat
        at <strong>Initiative</strong> 1. Your Visitor is a Minion equal to your
        own Level. The Conjure gesture scales with <strong>Wisdom</strong> and
        the Visitor survives for <strong>12 Rounds</strong>. You may only have
        one active Visitor. Casting another spell using the Conjure gesture
        replaces your previous Visitor. This gesture requires <strong>2

        unlocks Iconic Spell slots which provide a limited number of special
        spells which you know. These Iconic Spells have specialized effects

        requires.</p><h2 class="divider">Learning Iconic Spells</h2><p>Each

        provided you possess the prerequisite knowledge to learn it.</p><h2

        <p>Countermagic is the art of magical defence, weaving opposing
        spellcraft to negate the spell being cast by an opponent. Constructing a
        proper counterspell requires a degree of magical knowledge and an
        ability to process that knowledge in an asymmetric way, as you may not
        always have all the information needed to build your opposition
        correctly. Someone with a deep understanding of magic may be able to
        easily identify the telltale signs of specific Runes being used,
        identify a gesture, or interpret an inflection and glean the purpose of
        a spell. Someone practiced in Countermagic may find unique ways to
        disrupt a spell being cast, including sapping the magical energies from
        it at inception.</p><section class="construction"><p>The Counterspell
