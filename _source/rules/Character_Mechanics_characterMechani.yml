        <p><strong>Defenses</strong> are a set of attributes for each character
        which define how difficult certain actions are to take against that
        character. The higher a defense value, the harder it is to perform an
        action which targets that defense. Success on a test against a defense
        target requires the roll to exceed the defense value, the defender is
        successful on a tie.</p><p>The defense types in the Crucible system
        are:</p><h2 class="divider">Physical Defense</h2><p><strong>Physical
        Defense</strong> describes how difficult the creature is to hit with
        physical attacks, typically melee or ranged weapon strikes. Physical
        Defense is composed of four components. Total Physical Defense is equal
        to:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Physical Defense</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">Armor + Dodge + Parry +
        Block</p></section><p>When an attack misses because it is less than or
        equal to the Physical Defense total, it is assigned a type of miss based
        on the proportional mixture of Physical Defense
        components.</p><dl><dt><p>Armor</p></dt><dd><p>Protection offered by
        worn equipment or organic attributes like scales or chitin. Strikes
        which fail to hit and are defended by Armor assume the
        <strong>Deflected</strong> outcome. Unlike other physical defense
        outcomes, Deflection still results in some damage as long as the attack
        roll was not a Critical Failure; more than 6 less than the Physical
        Defense target. The residual damage dealt from a Deflection is also
        called a <strong>Glancing
        Blow.</strong></p></dd><dt><p>Dodge</p></dt><dd><p>Protection offered by
        physical quickness and agility. Strikes which fail to hit and are
        defended by the Dodge defense assume the <strong>Dodged</strong>
        outcome. Dodged attacks deal no damage and provide opportunity for
        dodge-based reactions.</p></dd><dt><p>Parry</p></dt><dd><p>Protection
        offered by guarding against an attack using an equipped weapon. Strikes
        which fail to hit and are defended by the Parry defense assume the
        <strong>Parried</strong> outcome. Parried attacks deal no damage and
        provide opportunity for parry-based
        reactions.</p></dd><dt><p>Block</p></dt><dd><p>Protection offered by
        guarding against an attack using an equipped shield or blocking weapon.
        Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the Block defense assume
        the <strong>Blocked </strong>outcome. Blocked attacks deal no damage and
        provide opportunity for block-based reactions.</p></dd></dl><h2
        class="divider">Non-Physical Defenses</h2><p>The three non-physical
        defenses are used to protect against spells or other abilities which are
        non-corporeal or intangible in
        nature.</p><h4>Fortitude</h4><p><strong>Fortitude Defense</strong>
        describes a character's ability to withstand bodily harm. Fortitude is
        modified by <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Wisdom</strong> which
        represent physical resistance and mental resilience respectively.
        Fortitude defense is calculated as:</p><section class="formula"><p
        class="value">Fortitude Defense</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">12 + ((Strength + Wisdom) / 2) + Fortitude
        Bonus</p></section><h4>Willpower</h4><p><strong>Willpower
        Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to withstand mental or
        emotional attacks. Willpower is modified by <strong>Toughness</strong>
        and <strong>Presence</strong> which represent physical grit and mental
        determination respectively. Willpower defense is calculated
        as:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Willpower Defense</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + ((Toughness + Presence) /
        2) + Willpower Bonus</p></section><h4>Reflex</h4><p><strong>Reflex
        Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to avoid harm that
        would otherwise occur in a specific area. Reflex is modified by
        <strong>Dexterity</strong> and <strong>Intellect</strong> which
        represent quickness of body and rapidity of thought respectively. Reflex
        defense is calculated as:</p><section class="formula"><p
        class="value">Reflex Defense</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">12 + ((Dexterity + Intellect) / 2) + Reflex
        Bonus</p></section><p>Note that Reflex is typically used as the defense
        type for intangible - but otherwise physical - sources of harm, while
        Physical Defense is used to defend against tangible
        attacks.</p><h4>Defense Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these non-physical
        defenses may be obtained through Talents or magical Equipment.</p><h2
        class="divider">Restoration Thresholds</h2><p><strong>Restoration
        Thresholds</strong> describe a pair of defenses which dictate how
        challenging it is to restore a creature's resources through healing or
        rallying actions.</p><h4>Healing Threshold</h4><p><strong>Healing
        Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Health
        of a creature. As creatures become more severely wounded, they grow more
        difficult to heal. This provides a measure of attrition which requires
        adventures to carefully manage their accumulation of <strong>Wounds
        </strong>over time. Healing threshold is calculated as:</p><section
        class="formula"><p class="value">Healing Threshold</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + (Wounds / 10) -
        Bonus</p></section><h4>Rallying Threshold</h4><p><strong>Rallying
        Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Morale
        of a creature. As creatures become more psychologically damaged they
        become more difficult to rally. This provides a measure of attrition
        which requires adventurers to carefully manage their accumulation of
        <strong>Madness</strong> over time. Rallying threshold is calculated
        as:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Rallying
        Threshold</p><p class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + (Madness /
        10) - Bonus</p></section><h4>Threshold Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these
        Restoration Threshold defenses may be obtained through Talents or
        magical Equipment. Since higher thresholds make a character more
        difficult to heal, bonuses to these defenses lower the threshold instead
        of increasing it.</p>

        <p><strong>Resources </strong>refers to the family of attributes which
        represent a character's wellbeing and ability to act. Each resource is a
        "pool", featuring a current and maximum value. The minimum value for all
        resources is zero.</p><h2 class="divider">Physical and Mental
        Health</h2><p>Maintaining the physical and mental health of your
        character is an ever-present challenge. Crucible uses two separate pools
        to represent the hero's state of wellbeing.</p><dl><dt><p>Health and
        Wounds</p></dt><dd><p>The physical health of a character is modeled
        using two resource pools. <strong>Health</strong> is a temporary
        resource which begins full and is decreased when a character sustains
        damage in combat. <strong>Wounds</strong> are a permanent resource which
        increase when a character suffers grievous injury.</p><p>If the Health
        pool is reduced to zero, the character becomes
        <strong>Incapacitated</strong> and begins to suffer Wounds. If the
        Wounds meter reaches its maximum, the character becomes
        <strong>Dead</strong>.</p></dd><dt><p>Morale and
        Madness</p></dt><dd><p>The mental health of a character is similarly
        modeled using two resource pools. <strong>Morale</strong> is a temporary
        resource which begins full and is decreased as the character suffers
        stress or trauma. <strong>Madness</strong> is a permanent resource which
        increases when a character suffers grievous mental strain.</p></dd><p>If
        the Morale pool is reduced to zero, the character becomes
        <strong>Broken</strong> and begins to suffer Madness. If the Madness
        meter reaches its maximum, the character becomes
        <strong>Insane</strong>.</p></dl><h2 class="divider">Capacity for
        Action</h2><p>Two resource pools define a character's ability to take
        action during game
        situations.</p><dl><dt><p>Action</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Action
        </strong>describes a character's capacity for rapid action during each
        round of a combat encounter. Characters typically have a pool of 6
        Action, all six of which replenish at the start of their turn in
        combat.</p></dd><dt><p>Focus</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Focus</strong>
        describes a character's capacity for extraordinary feats of heroism or
        magic. A character's Focus is replenished when they successfully rest,
        but during the midst of combat Focus must be used thoughtfully as it
        will not naturally
        replenish.</p></dd><dt><p>Heroism</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Heroism</strong>
        is a special generated resource that allows you to perform spectacular
        feats of magic or heroic prowess. Heroism is earned over the course of —
        typically longer — combat encounters allowing you to narratively unleash
        your most powerful abilities once the tension of battle has
        peaked!</p></dd></dl><h2 class="divider">Recovering
        Resources</h2><p>During Combat, Health and Morale may only be recovered
        by Actions or Talents which provide <strong>Restoration</strong>.
        Outside of Combat, it is possible to use the <strong>Recover</strong>
        action which consumes 10 minutes of time and fully replenishes your
        Health, Morale, Action, and Focus pools.</p><p>In order to reduce the
        accumulation of Wounds or Madness, long-term <strong>Rest</strong> is
        required. Rest mechanics are not implemented in Playtest One. The means
        and rate at which Wounds and Madness are reduced will be more fully
        articulated in a later phase of development.</p>

        <p><strong>Damage Resistance</strong> allows a character in Crucible to
        shrug off or succumb to more damage than normal. Specific creature types
        may be vulnerable to certain types of damage, conversely some of the
        most terrifying adversaries are ones that can ignore significant
        portions of damage that they take.</p><blockquote><p>Most creatures
        which are resistant to a certain damage type are vulnerable to some
        other damage type - if you encounter a creature which is overly
        effective at withstanding your blows - switch
        tactics!</p></blockquote><h2>Damage Types</h2><p>The Crucible system
        uses the following 12 <strong>Damage Types</strong>, each of which has a
        corresponding <strong>Resistance</strong> or
        <strong>Vulnerability</strong>. Additionally, each damage type has an
        associated
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.crucibleConditio.JournalEntryPage.conditionsOvervi]{Condition}
        which can be caused as a consequence of that damage type, usually as a
        result of a <strong>Critical
        Hit</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Physical Damage
        Types</p></th><th><p>Related
        Conditions</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Bludgeoning</p></td><td><p>Concussed</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Piercing</p></td><td><p>Bleeding</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Slashing</p></td><td><p>Bleeding</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Poison</p></td><td><p>Poisoned</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>Elemental

        and Maximum Damage</h2><p>When an Action deals damage as an immediate
        consequence (called "direct damage") the minimum amount of damage that
        can be dealt is 1, even if the creature has Resistance that exceeds the
        amount of damage dealt.</p><p>Some actions cause a downstream effect
        which deals damage upon a later Turn of combat (called "damage over
        time"). Damage over time can be completely negated by resistance; the
        minimum damage in such cases is zero.</p><p>When a creature is
        vulnerable to a type of damage dealt, the amount of damage dealt is
        increased by the amount of the vulnerability. This increase in damage is
        limited by the base amount of damage dealt; maximum damage against a
        vulnerable target is two times the amount of damage dealt.</p><section
        class="gameplay"><h4>Example: Damage Vulnerability</h4><p>Suppose a
        volatile Fire Elemental has vulnerability of <strong>-20</strong> to
        Cold damage. If the elemental is dealt <strong>7</strong> Cold damage
        before vulnerability is applied, the total result will be
        <strong>14</strong> Cold damage.</p></section>

        <p><strong>Ability Scores</strong> approximate facets of a character's
        physical and mental capability. All dice checks in the Crucible system
        are modified by at least one ability score of the character performing

        <p>Talents represent unique combinations of abilities a particular

        beyond skill advancement. Talents allow characters to define their role

        subcomponents which help you plot growth and progression for your
        character.</p><h2 class="divider">Nodes</h2><p>Each sextant of the
        Talent tree is composed of a number of <strong>Nodes</strong> which can
        contain one or more <strong>Talents</strong>. A Node which lie closer to
        the border between two sextants will often feature abilities which
        relate to the themes of both ability scores.</p><p>Starting Nodes occur
        at the inner-most ring, and contain talents that are often prerequisites
        for later talents in the tree. These starter talents are best thought of
        as the first steps in defining what makes your character different from
        another in terms of their specific set of special abilities.</p><h2
        class="divider">Talents</h2><p>Talents are the smallest unit of the
        talent tree. Each talent grants your character-specific abilities or
        bonuses. Many Talents have requirements which must be met before they
        can be purchased, such as attaining a certain level of Ability bonus or
        degree of training in a Skill.</p><h2 class="divider">Signature
        Talents</h2><p>Talent nodes at the outer edges of the Talent Tree
        contain <strong>Signature Talents</strong>, powerful bonuses that
        "Spellblade" or "Dread Lord" which offer iconic abilities. Signature
        Talents represent the culmination of the abilities required to select
        them, and are mirrored across two ability scores. Taking a Signature
        Talent forms a bridge to its paired ability score, allowing you to
        continue your path of progression into that sextant regardless of
        whether you have already purchased lower-tier Talents.</p>

        <p><strong>Ancestry</strong> classifies the biology and physiology of a
        character in Crucible. Fantasy settings may feature a spectrum of
        species which are playable as characters. Crucible supports defining
        Ancestries for each of these options which are narratively and
        mechanically appropriate for your own game.</p><h2>Creating
        Ancestries</h2><p>Crucible is not designed for a specific game setting.
        Gamemasters are encouraged to create or modify Ancestries to fit the
        lore of their own worlds. To configure an Ancestry in Crucible, create a
        new <strong>Item</strong> with the <strong>Ancestry</strong> type. Fill
        out the Ancestry configuration sheet to select a primary Ability score,
        a secondary Ability score, and optionally Resistance and Vulnerability
        to two different damage types. Every Ancestry may either have both a
        Resistance and a Vulnerability, or neither.</p><p>Each Ancestry
        includes:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>Primary Ability</strong> Score (which
        begins at 3)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Secondary Ability</strong> Score
        (which begins at 2)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Size</strong> value in grid
        spaces (typically 4)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Stride</strong> value in
        grid spaces that determines the starting movement speed (typically
        10)</p></li><li><p>Optional: A <strong>Damage Resistance</strong> to a
        certain type of damage (+3 resistance) — If a Damage Resistance is
        selected, a Damage Vulnerability MUST be
        selected.</p></li><li><p>Optional: A <strong>Damage
        Vulnerability</strong> to a certain type of damage (-3 vulnerability) —
        If a Damage Vulnerability is selected, a Damage Resistance MUST be
        selected.</p></li><li><p>An <strong>Ancestral Talent </strong>which
        grants a specific special ability or knowledge to a character of that
        ancestry.</p></li></ul><h2>Example Ancestries</h2><p>Crucible provides
        the following Ancestries for the purposes of playtesting which are
        familiar to typical fantasy role-playing settings. A collection of
        sample ancestries which are provided for the initial playtest are
        presented in the following

        class="divider">Flexible Ancestry</h2><section
        class="foundryvtt"><p>While Crucible will allow use of custom ancestries
        in a future version, there is no convenient way to modify an ancestry
        for this purpose at this as part of the character creation workflow at
        this time.</p></section><p>Role-playing games inspire and thrill us with
        tales of heroes who are exceptional and unique. Biological traits do not
        guarantee physical attributes, nor are species meant to be homogenous or
        monolithic (unless narratively intended). Gamemasters are empowered and
        encouraged to modify or customize Ancestries to suit the stories they
        and their players wish to tell. Consider Ancestral traits as suggestions
        rather than requirements.</p><section class="gameplay"><p>Alex (a
        player) intends to roleplay as an Orc who, at the beginning of their
        journey, is not particularly tough but instead unusually wise. In such
        cases the initial Ability Scores of <strong>3 Strength</strong> and
        <strong>2 Toughness</strong> that the example Orcish Ancestry provides
        are at odds with the character development Alex desires. The Gamemaster
        can work with Alex to create a variation of the Orcish ancestry which
        offers different starting Ability Scores, for example by swapping the
        Primary Ability from Strength to Wisdom.</p></section>
