        <p><strong>Defenses</strong> are a set of attributes for each character
        which define how difficult certain actions are to take against that
        character. The higher a defense value, the harder it is to perform an
        action which targets that defense. Success on a test against a defense
        target requires the roll to exceed the defense value, the defender is
        successful on a tie.</p><p>The defense types in the Crucible system
        are:</p><h2 class="divider">Physical Defense</h2><p><strong>Physical
        Defense</strong> describes how difficult the creature is to hit with
        physical attacks, typically melee or ranged weapon strikes. Physical
        Defense is composed of four components. Total Physical Defense is equal
        to:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Physical Defense</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">Armor + Dodge + Parry +
        Block</p></section><p>When an attack misses because it is less than or
        equal to the Physical Defense total, it is assigned a type of miss based
        on the proportional mixture of Physical Defense
        components.</p><h4>Armor</h4><p>Protection offered by worn equipment or
        organic attributes like scales or chitin. Strikes which fail to hit and
        are defended by Armor assume the <strong>Deflected</strong> outcome.
        Unlike other physical defense outcomes, Deflection still results in some
        damage as long as the attack roll was not a Critical Failure; more than
        6 less than the Physical Defense target. The residual damage dealt from
        a Deflection is also called a <strong>Glancing
        Blow.</strong></p><h4>Dodge</h4><p>Protection offered by physical
        quickness and agility. Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the
        Dodge defense assume the <strong>Dodged</strong> outcome. Dodged attacks
        deal no damage and provide opportunity for dodge-based
        reactions.</p><h4>Parry</h4><p>Protection offered by guarding against an
        attack using an equipped weapon. Strikes which fail to hit and are
        defended by the Parry defense assume the <strong>Parried</strong>
        outcome. Parried attacks deal no damage and provide opportunity for
        parry-based reactions.</p><h4>Block</h4><p>Protection offered by
        guarding against an attack using an equipped shield or blocking weapon.
        Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the Block defense assume
        the <strong>Blocked </strong>outcome. Blocked attacks deal no damage and
        provide opportunity for block-based reactions.</p><h2
        class="divider">Non-Physical Defenses</h2><p>The three non-physical
        defenses are used to protect against spells or other abilities which are
        non-corporeal or intangible in
        nature.</p><h4>Fortitude</h4><p><strong>Fortitude Defense</strong>
        describes a character's ability to withstand bodily harm. Fortitude is
        modified by <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Wisdom</strong> which
        represent physical resistance and mental resilience respectively.
        Fortitude defense is calculated as:</p><section class="formula"><p
        class="value">Fortitude Defense</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">12 + ((Strength + Wisdom) / 2) + Fortitude
        Bonus</p></section><h4>Willpower</h4><p><strong>Willpower
        Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to withstand mental or
        emotional attacks. Willpower is modified by <strong>Toughness</strong>
        and <strong>Presence</strong> which represent physical grit and mental
        determination respectively. Willpower defense is calculated
        as:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Willpower Defense</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + ((Toughness + Presence) /
        2) + Willpower Bonus</p></section><h4>Reflex</h4><p><strong>Reflex
        Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to avoid harm that
        would otherwise occur in a specific area. Reflex is modified by
        <strong>Dexterity</strong> and <strong>Intellect</strong> which
        represent quickness of body and rapidity of thought respectively. Reflex
        defense is calculated as:</p><section class="formula"><p
        class="value">Reflex Defense</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">12 + ((Dexterity + Intellect) / 2) + Reflex
        Bonus</p></section><p>Note that Reflex is typically used as the defense
        type for intangible - but otherwise physical - sources of harm, while
        Physical Defense is used to defend against tangible
        attacks.</p><h4>Defense Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these non-physical
        defenses may be obtained through Talents or magical Equipment.</p><h2
        class="divider">Restoration Thresholds</h2><p><strong>Restoration
        Thresholds</strong> describe a pair of defenses which dictate how
        challenging it is to restore a creature's resources through healing or
        rallying actions.</p><h4>Healing Threshold</h4><p><strong>Healing
        Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Health
        of a creature. As creatures become more severely wounded, they grow more
        difficult to heal. This provides a measure of attrition which requires
        adventures to carefully manage their accumulation of <strong>Wounds
        </strong>over time. Healing threshold is calculated as:</p><section
        class="formula"><p class="value">Healing Threshold</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + (Wounds / 10) -
        Bonus</p></section><h4>Rallying Threshold</h4><p><strong>Rallying
        Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Morale
        of a creature. As creatures become more psychologically damaged they
        become more difficult to rally. This provides a measure of attrition
        which requires adventurers to carefully manage their accumulation of
        <strong>Madness</strong> over time. Rallying threshold is calculated
        as:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Rallying
        Threshold</p><p class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + (Madness /
        10) - Bonus</p></section><h4>Threshold Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these
        Restoration Threshold defenses may be obtained through Talents or
        magical Equipment. Since higher thresholds make a character more
        difficult to heal, bonuses to these defenses lower the threshold instead
        of increasing it.</p>

        <p><strong>Resources </strong>refers to the family of attributes which
        represent a character's wellbeing and ability to act. Each resource is a
        "pool", featuring a current and maximum value. The minimum value for all
        resources is zero.</p><h2 class="divider">Physical and Mental
        Health</h2><p>Maintaining the physical and mental health of your
        character is an ever-present challenge. Crucible uses two separate pools
        to represent the hero's state of wellbeing.</p><h4>Health and
        Wounds</h4><p>The physical health of a character is modeled using two
        resource pools. <strong>Health</strong> is a temporary resource which
        begins full and is decreased when a character sustains damage in combat.
        <strong>Wounds</strong> are a permanent resource which increase when a
        character suffers grievous injury.</p><p>If the Health pool is reduced
        to zero, the character becomes <strong>Incapacitated</strong> and begins
        to suffer Wounds. If the Wounds meter reaches its maximum, the character
        becomes <strong>Dead</strong>.</p><h4>Morale and Madness</h4><p>The
        mental health of a character is similarly modeled using two resource
        pools. <strong>Morale</strong> is a temporary resource which begins full
        and is decreased as the character suffers stress or trauma.
        <strong>Madness</strong> is a permanent resource which increases when a
        character suffers grievous mental strain.</p><p>If the Morale pool is
        reduced to zero, the character becomes <strong>Broken</strong> and
        begins to suffer Madness. If the Madness meter reaches its maximum, the
        character becomes <strong>Insane</strong>.</p><h2
        class="divider">Capacity for Action</h2><p>Two resource pools define a
        character's ability to take action during game
        situations.</p><h4>Action</h4><p><strong>Action </strong>describes a
        character's capacity for rapid action during each round of a combat
        encounter. Characters typically have a pool of 6 Action, all six of
        which replenish at the start of their turn in
        combat.</p><h4>Focus</h4><p><strong>Focus</strong> describes a
        character's capacity for extraordinary feats of heroism or magic. A
        character's Focus is replenished when they successfully rest, but during
        the midst of combat Focus must be used thoughtfully as it will not
        naturally replenish.</p><h4>Heroism</h4><p><strong>Heroism</strong> is a
        special generated resource that allows you to perform spectacular feats
        of magic or heroic prowess. Heroism is earned over the course of —
        typically longer — combat encounters allowing you to narratively unleash
        your most powerful abilities once the tension of battle has
        peaked!</p><h2 class="divider">Recovering Resources</h2><p>During
        Combat, Health and Morale may only be recovered by Actions or Talents
        which provide <strong>Restoration</strong>. Outside of Combat, it is
        possible to use the <strong>Recover</strong> action which consumes 10
        minutes of time and fully replenishes your Health, Morale, Action, and
        Focus pools.</p><p>In order to reduce the accumulation of Wounds or
        Madness, long-term <strong>Rest</strong> is required. Rest mechanics are
        not implemented in Playtest One. The means and rate at which Wounds and
        Madness are reduced will be more fully articulated in a later phase of
        development.</p>

        <p><strong>Damage Resistance</strong> allows a character in Crucible to
        shrug off or succumb to more damage than normal. Specific creature types
        may be vulnerable to certain types of damage, conversely some of the
        most terrifying adversaries are ones that can ignore significant
        portions of damage that they take.</p><blockquote><p>Most creatures
        which are resistant to a certain damage type are vulnerable to some
        other damage type - if you encounter a creature which is overly
        effective at withstanding your blows - switch
        tactics!</p></blockquote><h2>Damage Types</h2><p>The Crucible system
        uses the following 12 <strong>Damage Types</strong>, each of which has a
        corresponding <strong>Resistance</strong> or
        <strong>Vulnerability</strong>. Additionally, each damage type has an
        associated
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c.JournalEntryPage.USjhhuOGsLTXQM9v]{Condition}
        which can be caused as a consequence of that damage type, usually as a
        result of a <strong>Critical
        Hit</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Physical Damage
        Types</p></th><th><p>Related
        Conditions</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Bludgeoning</p></td><td><p>Concussed</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Piercing</p></td><td><p>Bleeding</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Slashing</p></td><td><p>Bleeding</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Poison</p></td><td><p>Poisoned</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>Elemental

        and Maximum Damage</h2><p>When an Action deals damage as an immediate
        consequence (called "direct damage") the minimum amount of damage that
        can be dealt is 1, even if the creature has Resistance that exceeds the
        amount of damage dealt.</p><p>Some actions cause a downstream effect
        which deals damage upon a later Turn of combat (called "damage over
        time"). Damage over time can be completely negated by resistance; the
        minimum damage in such cases is zero.</p><p>When a creature is
        vulnerable to a type of damage dealt, the amount of damage dealt is
        increased by the amount of the vulnerability. This increase in damage is
        limited by the base amount of damage dealt; maximum damage against a
        vulnerable target is two times the amount of damage dealt.</p><section
        class="gameplay"><h4>Example: Damage Vulnerability</h4><p>Suppose a
        volatile Fire Elemental has vulnerability of <strong>-20</strong> to
        Cold damage. If the elemental is dealt <strong>7</strong> Cold damage
        before vulnerability is applied, the total result will be
        <strong>14</strong> Cold damage.</p></section>
