        <p><strong>Defenses</strong> are a set of attributes for each character
        which define how difficult certain actions are to take against that
        character. The higher a defense value, the harder it is to perform an
        action which targets that defense. Success on a test against a defense
        target requires the roll to exceed the defense value, the defender is
        successful on a tie.</p><p>The defense types in the Crucible system
        are:</p><h2 class="divider">Physical Defense</h2><p><strong>Physical
        Defense</strong> describes how difficult the creature is to hit with
        physical attacks, typically melee or ranged weapon strikes. Physical
        Defense is composed of four components. Total Physical Defense is equal
        to:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Physical Defense</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">Armor + Dodge + Parry +
        Block</p></section><p>When an attack misses because it is less than or
        equal to the Physical Defense total, it is assigned a type of miss based
        on the proportional mixture of Physical Defense
        components.</p><dl><dt><p>Armor</p></dt><dd><p>Protection offered by
        worn equipment or organic attributes like scales or chitin. Strikes
        which fail to hit and are defended by Armor assume the
        <strong>Deflected</strong> outcome. Unlike other physical defense
        outcomes, Deflection still results in some damage as long as the attack
        roll was not a Critical Failure; more than 6 less than the Physical
        Defense target. The residual damage dealt from a Deflection is also
        called a <strong>Glancing
        Blow.</strong></p></dd><dt><p>Dodge</p></dt><dd><p>Protection offered by
        physical quickness and agility. Strikes which fail to hit and are
        defended by the Dodge defense assume the <strong>Dodged</strong>
        outcome. Dodged attacks deal no damage and provide opportunity for
        dodge-based reactions.</p></dd><dt><p>Parry</p></dt><dd><p>Protection
        offered by guarding against an attack using an equipped weapon. Strikes
        which fail to hit and are defended by the Parry defense assume the
        <strong>Parried</strong> outcome. Parried attacks deal no damage and
        provide opportunity for parry-based
        reactions.</p></dd><dt><p>Block</p></dt><dd><p>Protection offered by
        guarding against an attack using an equipped shield or blocking weapon.
        Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the Block defense assume
        the <strong>Blocked </strong>outcome. Blocked attacks deal no damage and
        provide opportunity for block-based reactions.</p></dd></dl><h2
        class="divider">Non-Physical Defenses</h2><p>The three non-physical
        defenses are used to protect against spells or other abilities which are
        non-corporeal or intangible in
        nature.</p><h4>Fortitude</h4><p><strong>Fortitude Defense</strong>
        describes a character's ability to withstand bodily harm. Fortitude is
        modified by <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Wisdom</strong> which
        represent physical resistance and mental resilience respectively.
        Fortitude defense is calculated as:</p><section class="formula"><p
        class="value">Fortitude Defense</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">12 + ((Strength + Wisdom) / 2) + Fortitude
        Bonus</p></section><h4>Willpower</h4><p><strong>Willpower
        Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to withstand mental or
        emotional attacks. Willpower is modified by <strong>Toughness</strong>
        and <strong>Presence</strong> which represent physical grit and mental
        determination respectively. Willpower defense is calculated
        as:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Willpower Defense</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + ((Toughness + Presence) /
        2) + Willpower Bonus</p></section><h4>Reflex</h4><p><strong>Reflex
        Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to avoid harm that
        would otherwise occur in a specific area. Reflex is modified by
        <strong>Dexterity</strong> and <strong>Intellect</strong> which
        represent quickness of body and rapidity of thought respectively. Reflex
        defense is calculated as:</p><section class="formula"><p
        class="value">Reflex Defense</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">12 + ((Dexterity + Intellect) / 2) + Reflex
        Bonus</p></section><p>Note that Reflex is typically used as the defense
        type for intangible - but otherwise physical - sources of harm, while
        Physical Defense is used to defend against tangible
        attacks.</p><h4>Defense Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these non-physical
        defenses may be obtained through Talents or magical Equipment.</p><h2
        class="divider">Restoration Thresholds</h2><p><strong>Restoration
        Thresholds</strong> describe a pair of defenses which dictate how
        challenging it is to restore a creature's resources through healing or
        rallying actions.</p><h4>Healing Threshold</h4><p><strong>Healing
        Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Health
        of a creature. As creatures become more severely wounded, they grow more
        difficult to heal. This provides a measure of attrition which requires
        adventures to carefully manage their accumulation of <strong>Wounds
        </strong>over time. Healing threshold is calculated as:</p><section
        class="formula"><p class="value">Healing Threshold</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + (Wounds / 10) -
        Bonus</p></section><h4>Rallying Threshold</h4><p><strong>Rallying
        Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Morale
        of a creature. As creatures become more psychologically damaged they
        become more difficult to rally. This provides a measure of attrition
        which requires adventurers to carefully manage their accumulation of
        <strong>Madness</strong> over time. Rallying threshold is calculated
        as:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Rallying
        Threshold</p><p class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + (Madness /
        10) - Bonus</p></section><h4>Threshold Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these
        Restoration Threshold defenses may be obtained through Talents or
        magical Equipment. Since higher thresholds make a character more
        difficult to heal, bonuses to these defenses lower the threshold instead
        of increasing it.</p>

        <p><strong>Resources </strong>refers to the family of attributes which
        represent a character's wellbeing and ability to act. Each resource is a
        "pool", featuring a current and maximum value. The minimum value for all
        resources is zero.</p><h2 class="divider">Physical and Mental
        Health</h2><p>Maintaining the physical and mental health of your
        character is an ever-present challenge. Crucible uses two separate pools
        to represent the hero's state of wellbeing.</p><dl><dt><p>Health and
        Wounds</p></dt><dd><p>The physical health of a character is modeled
        using two resource pools. <strong>Health</strong> is a temporary
        resource which begins full and is decreased when a character sustains
        damage in combat. <strong>Wounds</strong> are a permanent resource which
        increase when a character suffers grievous injury.</p><p>If the Health
        pool is reduced to zero, the character becomes
        <strong>Incapacitated</strong> and begins to suffer Wounds. If the
        Wounds meter reaches its maximum, the character becomes
        <strong>Dead</strong>.</p></dd><dt><p>Morale and
        Madness</p></dt><dd><p>The mental health of a character is similarly
        modeled using two resource pools. <strong>Morale</strong> is a temporary
        resource which begins full and is decreased as the character suffers
        stress or trauma. <strong>Madness</strong> is a permanent resource which
        increases when a character suffers grievous mental strain.</p></dd><p>If
        the Morale pool is reduced to zero, the character becomes
        <strong>Broken</strong> and begins to suffer Madness. If the Madness
        meter reaches its maximum, the character becomes
        <strong>Insane</strong>.</p></dl><h2 class="divider">Capacity for
        Action</h2><p>Two resource pools define a character's ability to take
        action during game
        situations.</p><dl><dt><p>Action</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Action
        </strong>describes a character's capacity for rapid action during each
        round of a combat encounter. Characters typically have a pool of 6
        Action, all six of which replenish at the start of their turn in
        combat.</p></dd><dt><p>Focus</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Focus</strong>
        describes a character's capacity for extraordinary feats of heroism or
        magic. A character's Focus is replenished when they successfully rest,
        but during the midst of combat Focus must be used thoughtfully as it
        will not naturally
        replenish.</p></dd><dt><p>Heroism</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Heroism</strong>
        is a special generated resource that allows you to perform spectacular
        feats of magic or heroic prowess. Heroism is earned over the course of —
        typically longer — combat encounters allowing you to narratively unleash
        your most powerful abilities once the tension of battle has
        peaked!</p></dd></dl><h2 class="divider">Recovering
        Resources</h2><p>During Combat, Health and Morale may only be recovered
        by Actions or Talents which provide <strong>Restoration</strong>.
        Outside of Combat, it is possible to use the <strong>Recover</strong>
        action which consumes 10 minutes of time and fully replenishes your
        Health, Morale, Action, and Focus pools.</p><p>In order to reduce the
        accumulation of Wounds or Madness, long-term <strong>Rest</strong> is
        required. Rest mechanics are not implemented in Playtest One. The means
        and rate at which Wounds and Madness are reduced will be more fully
        articulated in a later phase of development.</p>

        <p><strong>Damage Resistance</strong> allows a character in Crucible to
        shrug off or succumb to more damage than normal. Specific creature types
        may be vulnerable to certain types of damage, conversely some of the
        most terrifying adversaries are ones that can ignore significant
        portions of damage that they take.</p><blockquote><p>Most creatures
        which are resistant to a certain damage type are vulnerable to some
        other damage type - if you encounter a creature which is overly
        effective at withstanding your blows - switch
        tactics!</p></blockquote><h2 class="divider">Damage Types</h2><p>The
        Crucible system uses the following 12 <strong>Damage Types</strong>,
        each of which has a corresponding <strong>Resistance</strong> or
        <strong>Vulnerability</strong>. Additionally, each damage type has an
        associated
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.crucibleConditio.JournalEntryPage.conditionsOvervi]{Condition}
        which can be caused as a consequence of that damage type, usually as a

        class="divider">Damage Resistance</h2><p>When an Action deals damage,
        that damage may be reduced by an amount of Resistance that the target
        creature has. This amount of resistance may even reduce the damage
        caused by the Action to be zero!</p><section
        class="gameplay"><h4>Example: Damage Resistance</h4><p>Suppose a
        mechanical automaton, a Brass Sentinel, has resistance of
        <strong>+5</strong> to <strong>Slashing</strong> damage. If the Brass
        Sentinel receives an attack that deals <strong>13 Slashing
        damage</strong>, the effective damage dealt is reduced to <strong>8
        Slashing Damage</strong>.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Damage
        Vulnerability</h2><p>When a creature is vulnerable to a type of damage
        dealt, the amount of damage dealt is increased by the amount of the
        vulnerability. This increase in damage is limited by the base amount of
        damage dealt; maximum damage against a vulnerable target is two times
        the amount of damage dealt.</p><section class="gameplay"><h4>Example:
        Damage Vulnerability</h4><p>Suppose a volatile Fire Elemental has
        vulnerability of <strong>-20</strong> to <strong>Cold</strong> damage.
        If the elemental is dealt <strong>7 Cold damage</strong> before
        vulnerability is applied, the total result will be <strong>14 Cold
        damage</strong>.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Damage
        Immunity</h2><p>In exceptional cases, a creature may be entirely
        <strong>Immune</strong> to a certain damage type. In this case, the
        creature never takes damage of that type no matter its magnitude.</p>

        bonuses. Many Talents have requirements which must be met before they
        can be purchased, such as attaining a certain level of Ability bonus or
        degree of training in a Skill.</p><h2 class="divider">Training
        Talents</h2><p>Training talents are specific types of talent nodes that
        grant advancements to Skills, or progress Weapon or Tradecraft training.
        Weapon or Tradecraft Training Talents authorize your character to use
        particular weapons or to craft particular types of schematics, Skill
        Training Talents award the following benefits:</p><table><tbody><tr><th

        Talents</h2><p>Talent nodes at the outer edges of the Talent Tree
        contain <strong>Signature Talents</strong>, powerful bonuses that
        "Spellblade" or "Dread Lord" which offer iconic abilities. Signature
        Talents represent the culmination of the abilities required to select
        them, and are mirrored across two ability scores. Taking a Signature
        Talent forms a bridge to its paired ability score, allowing you to
        continue your path of progression into that sextant regardless of
        whether you have already purchased lower-tier Talents.</p>

        <p><strong>Ancestry</strong> classifies the biology and physiology of a
        character in Crucible. Fantasy settings may feature a spectrum of
        species which are playable as characters. Crucible supports defining
        Ancestries for each of these options which are narratively and
        mechanically appropriate for your own game.</p><h2
        class="divider">Creating Ancestries</h2><p>Crucible is not designed for
        a specific game setting. Gamemasters are encouraged to create or modify
        Ancestries to fit the lore of their own worlds. To configure an Ancestry
        in Crucible, create a new <strong>Item</strong> with the
        <strong>Ancestry</strong> type. Fill out the Ancestry configuration
        sheet to select a primary Ability score, a secondary Ability score, and
        optionally Resistance and Vulnerability to two different damage types.
        Every Ancestry may either have both a Resistance and a Vulnerability, or
        neither.</p><p>Each Ancestry includes:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>Primary
        Ability</strong> Score (which begins at 3)</p></li><li><p>A
        <strong>Secondary Ability</strong> Score (which begins at
        2)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Size</strong> value in grid spaces
        (typically 4)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Stride</strong> value in grid
        spaces that determines the starting movement speed (typically
        10)</p></li><li><p>Optional: A <strong>Damage Resistance</strong> to a
        certain type of damage (+3 resistance) — If a Damage Resistance is
        selected, a Damage Vulnerability MUST be
        selected.</p></li><li><p>Optional: A <strong>Damage
        Vulnerability</strong> to a certain type of damage (-3 vulnerability) —
        If a Damage Vulnerability is selected, a Damage Resistance MUST be
        selected.</p></li><li><p>An <strong>Ancestral Talent </strong>which
        grants a specific special ability or knowledge to a character of that

        Gamemasters are empowered and encouraged to modify or customize

        Toughness</strong> that the example Orcish Ancestry provides are at odds
        with the character development Alex desires. The Gamemaster can work
        with Alex to create a variation of the Orcish ancestry which offers
        different starting Ability Scores, for example by swapping the Primary
        Ability from Strength to Wisdom.</p></section>

        <p><strong>Skills</strong> represent the education or degree of
        professional training your character has received. These Skills might
        have been learned as part of their
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6.JournalEntryPage.uCwStnXHoUCV2TrK]{Background}
        or some other aspect of their life experience. Skills progress when a
        character selects a Training Talent. During
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6]{Character
        Creation}, some Training Talents are awarded during the selection of a
        Background.</p><p>More information on Training Talents can be found in

        class="divider">Exploration
        Skills</h2><dl><dt><p>Athletics</p></dt><dd><p>The
        <strong>Athletics</strong> skill represents the ability to undertake and
        surmount physical challenges. These could involve traversal of difficult
        terrain like climbing, running, or swimming, or could involve feats of
        strength, endurance, or
        flexibility.</p></dd><dt><p>Awareness</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Awareness</strong>
        is a measure of your skill in translating sensory input into useful
        information. A character with high Awareness is able to notice and
        interpret details that others might miss, and is able to quickly
        identify and react to
        threats.</p></dd><dt><p>Stealth</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Stealth</strong>
        covers the ability to hide effectively, to move without making a sound,
        to disguise oneself, and to otherwise use your environment to hide your
        presence. Those trained in Stealth focus on finding ways to remain
        unnoticed, whether sneaking in solitude through a dark alley at night,
        or blending in at a celebration at a crowded
        ballroom.</p></dd><dt><p>Wilderness</p></dt><dd><p>Those skilled in
        <strong>Wilderness</strong> learn to create shelter where there is none,
        identify which water is safe to drink and which is not, and locate
        sources of food in even the most inhospitable places, and to otherwise
        survive in harsh environments.</p></dd></dl><h2
        class="divider">Knowledge
        Skills</h2><dl><dt><p>Arcana</p></dt><dd><p>Whether the focus of the
        education is magical or religious in nature, <strong>Arcana</strong>
        encompasses the study of esoteric knowledge. Students of Arcana learn
        fundamental principles of metaphysics, study spiritual beings and
        deities, runic theory and ritual, the nature of chaos and order, and the
        history of how magical and spiritual forces impact societies and
        cultures.</p></dd><dt><p>Medicine</p></dt><dd><p>The study of
        <strong>Medicine</strong> is a practical one, with a focus on studying
        the mechanical, biological components that make up living creatures, the
        ailments that can afflict them, and the ways to best treat injury and
        illness
        alike.</p></dd><dt><p>Science</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Science</strong> is
        concerned with physical phenomena and examining the world through the
        lens of logic, reason, mathematics, and the use of structured
        observation. A student of science learns to posit and confirm theories,
        analyze the construction of physical objects and machines, and apply
        mathematical thinking.</p></dd><dt><p>Society</p></dt><dd><p>The
        <strong>Society</strong> skill is most often used for the purposes of
        research or understanding into the nuanced aspects of a social
        situation. Those educated in the workings of Society study the factors
        which contribute to social structures. Knowledge of Society is used to
        establish historical or socio-political context, to identify the social
        rank of particular individuals, or to otherwise draw connections between
        a person or place and its most likely contributors.</p></dd></dl><h2
        class="divider">Social
        Skills</h2><dl><dt><p>Deception</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Deception</strong>
        most commonly comes into play when a character is attempting to lie or
        mislead others, forge documents, or pierce the veil of lies others
        construct. Those who pursue an education in Deception are often
        politicians, diplomats, spies, thieves, or other professions for whom
        flexibility in the truth is a
        necessity.</p></dd><dt><p>Diplomacy</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Diplomacy</strong>
        is rolled most often to persuade others to see things your way. A skill
        most commonly found in the politically savvy or influential orators,
        Diplomacy allows for the use of rhetoric and emotional appeals to
        inspire and convince others. Diplomats focus their efforts on the use of
        words, rather than deeds, to change opinions and inspire emotional
        reactions.</p></dd><dt><p>Intimidation</p></dt><dd><p><strong>Intimidation</strong>
        is used to force others to do your bidding, whether through displays of
        aggression or threats of violence. Those trained in the art of
        intimidation are capable of using their words and actions to inspire
        fear in others, to demonstrate dominance or press others into
        subservience. Those who train their skill in intimidation need not
        necessarily be physically imposing in terms of stature, for words and
        deeds can be equally capable of inspiring
        fear.</p></dd><dt><p>Performance</p></dt><dd><p>Those who study
        <strong>Performance</strong> learn, above all else, how to use their
        talents to inspire and entertain others whether through music, dance,
        storytelling, or other forms of artistic expression.. Performers learn
        verse and music, use of pigment and light, poetry and story, dance and
        even physical feats to evoke emotional reactions in
        others.</p></dd></dl><h2>Skill Checks</h2><p>There are often situations
        that require a character to confirm their capabilities. At any time GM
        may call for a <strong>Skill Check</strong>— a simple roll to test
        whether you have sufficient skill to perform an action or recall some
        piece of information. Each skill is associated with two

        class="gameplay"><h4>Example: Rolling a Skill Check</h4><p>Albert, our
        storied naval captain from a previous example, is faced with a dilemma.
        His ship is about to be imperiled by a storm, and his crew is looking to
        him to safely navigate out of the harbor. Albert relies on his Master
        skills in Wilderness to try and overcome a Challenging (DC25) roll.
        </p><p>Albert rolls a Wilderness check with dice results of
        <strong>6</strong>, <strong>4</strong>, and <strong>7</strong> for a
        total of <strong>17</strong>. The Wilderness skill scales using
        Toughness and Wisdom. Albert has 5 Toughness and 9 Wisdom, resulting in
        a <strong>+4 Ability Bonus</strong>. Albert has a <strong>+3 Skill
        Bonus</strong> from Master level training and a magical set of nautical
        charts that provide a <strong>+2 Enchantment Bonus</strong>. Albert's
        total result on the roll is a <strong>26</strong>, narrowly succeeding
        on the test!</p></section><h2 class="divider">Passive Skill
        Checks</h2><p>Crucible allows any skill check to be considered passive
        at the discretion of the gamemaster. In a case where a character's
        trained skill rank is sufficient to exceed the DC of a roll by adding 12
        to it, the check is considered successful without a need to
        roll.</p><p></p><h2 class="divider">Group Skill Checks</h2><section
        class="foundryvtt"><p>Crucible's handling of Group Skill Checks is a
        work in progress at this time, please look forward to a future update
        that adds this functionality.</p></section><p></p>
