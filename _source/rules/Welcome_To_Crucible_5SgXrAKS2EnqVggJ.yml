        <p><strong>Crucible</strong> is an innovative and modern role-playing
        game (RPG) system built exclusively for <strong>Foundry Virtual
        Tabletop</strong> as a digital platform.</p><p>Crucible is designed from
        the ground up to leverage the unique capabilities of Foundry Virtual
        Tabletop to create exciting and fast-paced gameplay that allow
        gamemasters and players to focus on what matters most: <em>telling a
        compelling story</em>.</p><p>At the heart of Crucible is meaningful and
        empowering character advancement through a class-less system with
        multiple pillars of character progression. The system’s dice mechanics
        allow for crunchy and tactically rich encounters featuring combat,
        exploration, or social challenges.</p><p>Crucible is both a role-playing
        game and a software engine. The game system offers a deep level of
        mechanical sophistication, but its rules are entirely encoded to be
        applied with consistency and automation. The system is built
        intentionally to eliminate the cumbersome bookkeeping that is prevalent
        in high-crunch pen-and-paper systems.</p><h2 class="divider">Development
        Status</h2><p>Crucible is now available for an initial <strong>Alpha
        Playtest</strong> which provides the community with a first look at the
        system, design pillars, and intended direction. The system is moderately
        functional, but still early in development. All areas of the system are
        works-in-progress and some areas are not yet developed at all. This
        playtest offers a chance for us to collect early feedback and share our
        work with the community. Please approach it with an open mind and an
        understanding that what you are seeing is still a long way from a
        finished product.</p><section class="construction"><p>Blocks like this
        one in the system documentation highlight areas of the system that still
        require substantial development. These are intended to make you aware of
        areas that are intentionally unfinished at this
        time.</p></section><p>Development of Crucible is two-pronged with an
        equal focus on developing the system mechanics of the roleplaying game
        and the software implementation of those mechanics simultaneously. As
        the game mechanics evolve, new developments of the game system will
        enable those features for use in testing. The playtest process allows us
        to solicit and benefit from feedback that helps us iterate on the game
        rules and the user experience in Foundry Virtual Tabletop. We anticipate
        hosting multiple rounds of feedback, each focusing on a different aspect
        of the game experience.</p><h2 class="divider">Playtest One</h2><p>The
        first playtest,
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.playtest.Adventure.F8AILycmdj2kuOVa]{Playtest
        1 - The Ring of Valor}, is focused on
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6]{Character
        Creation} and
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c]{Combat
        Encounters}. This playtest provides an abbreviated introduction to the
        Crucible game system, covering character creation, dice mechanics,
        combat encounters, and level advancement. The playtest begins at level 1
        and advances characters through level 6 allowing them to evolve and
        advance their character between each challenge of the test.</p><section
        class="construction"><p>Please note that the rules and mechanics
        featured in this playtest are not final. Most talents, skills, and rules
        will be further refined during later phases of
        development.</p></section>

        <p>Crucible is built with the following cornerstones and design
        principles in mind.</p><h2>Consequential Character Progression</h2><p>A
        primary goal for Crucible is to provide systems for meaningful,
        exciting, and impactful character progression. Creating and advancing a
        character in Crucible should be enjoyable and impactful as you gain
        access to new capabilities that tangibly evolve your playstyle and
        character persona.</p><h2>Strategic Grid-Based Combat</h2><p>Game
        mechanics in Crucible are designed for application to encounter or area
        maps with a structured grid which defines distances and positions of
        characters to create tactical choices about movement during combat.
        Movement actions and costs, engagement, flanking, cover, area-of-effect
        abilities, and more are all ways to add tactical nuance and dynamism to
        combat.</p><h2>Consistently Automated Mechanics</h2><p>A key goal for
        Crucible is to design and implement mechanics which are seamlessly
        automated or theoretically capable of seamless automation. We don't want
        automation that distracts from gameplay with the need for bookkeeping -
        but we also want the underlying game mechanics which are automated to be
        understandable to players at the table. We don't want mechanics which
        are inscrutable simply because we have a layer of automation in front of
        them. In Crucible you will find game mechanics which are elegantly and
        intuitively designed, but our approach to full automation of those
        mechanics means you can stay focused on the fun of
        roleplaying.</p><h2>Bring Your Own Story</h2><p>Crucible is optimized
        and designed with extended-form narrative in mind. While it can be used
        for one-shot adventures, the system's mechanics are intended to play out
        over months or years of game sessions.</p><p>Crucible provides
        relatively little rule-based guidance around narrative, personal
        character story, or the development of intrapersonal relationships -
        deliberately leaving these narrative pillars for the Game Master and
        players to explore using whatever setting or storytelling style they
        most prefer.</p><p>Crucible intentionally does not define a canonical
        setting. The system provides Gamemasters with tools to apply the system
        to a variety of settings. As a general rule of thumb, Crucible will work
        best in a gritty fantasy setting but it can be adapted for other genres
        and tones.</p><h2>Ease of Powerful Use</h2><p>Crucible is designed to be
        a system which is easy to learn and easy to use. Gamemasters should feel
        empowered to tell the stories they want to tell, and players to play the
        characters they want to play. We want game mechanics in Crucible to be
        crunchy and strategic while being presented to players in a way that is
        intuitive and fun to engage with.</p>
