        <p>Talents represent unique combinations of abilities a particular
        character may have, and provide a level of customization and progression
        beyond skill advancement. Talents allow characters to define their role
        more clearly as they advance, growing steadily in power. Newly created
        characters begin with a small number of Talent Points, gaining more
        points at each level.</p><p>You can access the Talent Tree for a
        character at any time by opening the Talents tab and clicking the "Open
        Talent Tree" button.</p><section class="foundryvtt"><p>Interaction with
        the talent tree is similar to interaction with Scenes in ordinary
        Foundry VTT usage. Pan the tree using right-click and drag, and use
        mouse-wheel to zoom in and out. Left clicking any Node will expand it to
        reveal the Talents it may contain.</p><p>Left-clicking a Talent
        purchases that talent if you have points available, while right-clicking
        it will remove that talent from your character.</p><p>You may reset your
        purchases on the Talent Tree at any time by clicking the Reset button at
        the bottom.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Tree
        Layout</h2><p>Crucible's Talent Tree is divided into six sections, with
        each section representing a different
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6.JournalEntryPage.RHCy135mF4EN1mWZ]{Ability}
        which affects scaling and other aspects of those
        talents.</p><figure><img class="noborder"

        /><figcaption>The Talent Tree is divided into sextants based on
        Abilities</figcaption></figure><p>The Talent Tree is composed of several
        subcomponents which help you plot growth and progression for your
        character.</p><h2 class="divider">Nodes</h2><p>Each sextant of the
        Talent tree is composed of a number of <strong>Nodes</strong> which can
        contain one or more <strong>Talents</strong>. A Node which lie closer to
        the border between two sextants will often feature abilities which
        relate to the themes of both ability scores.</p><p>Starting Nodes occur
        at the inner-most ring, and contain talents that are often prerequisites
        for later talents in the tree. These starter talents are best thought of
        as the first steps in defining what makes your character different from
        another in terms of their specific set of special abilities.</p><h2
        class="divider">Talents</h2><p>Talents are the smallest unit of the
        talent tree. Each talent grants your character-specific abilities or
        bonuses. Many Talents have requirements which must be met before they
        can be purchased, such as attaining a certain level of Ability bonus or
        degree of training in a Skill.</p><h2 class="divider">Signature
        Talents</h2><p>Talent nodes at the outer edges of the Talent Tree
        contain <strong>Signature Talents</strong>, powerful bonuses that
        "Spellblade" or "Dread Lord" which offer iconic abilities. Signature
        Talents represent the culmination of the abilities required to select
        them, and are mirrored across two ability scores. Taking a Signature
        Talent forms a bridge to its paired ability score, allowing you to
        continue your path of progression into that sextant regardless of
        whether you have already purchased lower-tier Talents.</p>
