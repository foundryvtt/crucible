        <p><strong>Weapons</strong> are a specific Item type which represents
        items that are wielded in a character's hands and used in combat. The
        Crucible system provides the basic rules for creating and classifying
        weapons, and also provides an array of pre-defined weapon types which
        are typically observed in a fantasy role-playing game. These weapons can
        be browsed in the <strong>Weapons </strong>Compendium
        pack.</p><p>Weapons all have the following attributes, in addition to
        those shared by all items:</p><h4>Category</h4><p>The category of a
        weapon establishes certain parameters about how that weapon may be used.
        How many hands does it require to wield? Is it a melee weapon or a
        ranged weapon? Does it require ammunition? Which ability scores modify
        its usage? And more. The possible weapon categories are listed in the
        table below.</p><h4>Damage Type</h4><p>Each weapon deals a specific
        damage type when it inflicts damage in combat.</p><h4>Weapon
        Properties</h4><p>Weapons may have a number of special properties which
        instill that item with special rules functionality described in the
        table below.</p><h2 class="divider">Weapon Categories</h2><p>The

        and can never be increased after that point.</p><h4>Broken
        Weapons</h4><p>During the course of use, or over the passage of time,
        weapons may become <strong>Broken</strong>. Weapons which are Broken
        deal half their normal damage and cannot contribute to Block or Parry
        defenses. Repairing a Broken weapon restores it to its original quality
        tier or a lesser quality tier depending on the result of the
        <strong>Tradecraft </strong>skill check to repair the weapon.</p><h2
        class="divider">Enchantment Tier</h2><p><strong>Enchantment</strong> of
        a Weapon describes its level of magical imbuement. Enchantment tiers

        class="divider">Special Properties</h2><p>Some weapons may have one (or
        in very rare cases multiple) of the following special properties. Each
        of these properties adds a +1 Rarity modifier to the weapon.</p><section
        class="construction"><p>Several of the following properties, denoted
        with an <strong>*</strong> after their name, are not yet fully automated
        in the first Crucible Playtest system
        yet.</p></section><h4>Oversized</h4><p>This weapon is large for its
        category and is unwieldy in combat without special training. The weapon
        gains an additional +2 bonus to base damage but is slow and provides +2
        Banes to Initiative rolls.</p><h4>Reach</h4><p>This weapon is lengthy
        and offers an expanded attack range. The range of melee weapons is
        increased by +2 feet. Ranged weapons are expanded by +20
        feet.</p><h4>Parrying</h4><p>This weapon provides a bonus to Parry
        defense while equipped and not Broken. The bonus is +1 for one-handed
        weapons and +2 for two-handed weapons, plus the enchantment bonus of the
        weapon.</p><h4>Blocking</h4><p>This weapon provides a bonus to Block
        defense while equipped and not Broken. The bonus is +1 for one-handed
        weapons and +2 for two-handed weapons, plus the enchantment bonus of the
        weapon.</p><h4>Versatile*</h4><p>This normally one-handed weapon can be
        used effectively with two hands. While equipped without any item in the
        off-hand its base damage is increased by +2 and Action cost is increased
        by +1.</p><h4>Thrown*</h4><p>This weapon can be used to Strike at range
        up to a distance of 20 feet. When used to Strike a target that is not
        within melee range, the Weapon becomes unequipped and must be retrieved
        before it can be used again.</p><h4>Keen</h4><p>This weapon is capable
        of achieving particularly deadly strikes. The critical hit threshold of
        the weapon is reduced by 2 making it more likely that successful Strikes
        yield a critical hit.</p><h4>Reliable</h4><p>This weapon is trustworthy
        and almost never produces spectacularly bad outcomes. The critical
        failure threshold of the weapon is reduced by 2 making it less likely
        that unsuccessful Strikes yield a critical
        miss.</p><h4>Ambush</h4><p>This weapon can be easily concealed and
        retrieved quickly. This weapon may be drawn for free during your own
        turn or as part of a Reaction.</p><h4>Engaging</h4><p>This weapon is
        designed to better allow you to combat multiple foes, increasing your
        Engagement by +1.</p>

        <p><strong>Equipment</strong> refers to the belongings, weaponry, armor,
        potions, adventuring equipment, and other types of items which could be
        carried by a character or found somewhere within the world.</p><section
        class="construction"><p>The Crucible system will eventually support a
        number of different item types, but at the moment for initial
        playtesting only <strong>Armor</strong> and <strong>Weapon</strong>
        types are implemented.</p></section><p>Equipment types share a few
        properties in common across all types:</p><h4>Weight</h4><p>Each item
        has a per-unit weight, expressed in pounds.</p><h4>Base Cost</h4><p>The
        base cost of an item establishes the basis for any cost scaling which
        later applies. For some items the base cost and scaled cost are always
        the same, but some items can have a true value many times greater than
        the item's base cost.</p><h4>Physical Quality</h4><p>Many items may be
        assigned a quality tier which reflects the manufacturing quality or
        natural rarity of a certain commodity.</p><h4>Enchantment
        Tier</h4><p>Items which can be augmented with magic have an enchantment
        tier which reflects the potency of magic that is imbued into the
        item.</p><h4>Rarity</h4><p>Item rarity quantifies the uniqueness of the
        item relative to it's most common form. Items with higher manufactured
        quality, stronger magical enchantment, or rare properties will have a
        higher rarity value and therefore a greater value.</p><h2
        class="divider">Item Value Scaling</h2><p>The base cost of a weapon is
        defined by its Standard quality, Mundane enchantment variety. The
        currency cost of the weapon scales with its Rarity score according to
        the following formula:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Item
        Value</p><p class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">(1 + (Rarity^3) ×
        Base Cost</p></section><section class="gameplay"><p>Suppose a
        <strong>Standard</strong> quality and unenchanted
        <strong>Mundane</strong> Longsword has a base cost of 50. The same type
        of weapon crafted at <strong>Masterwork</strong> quality would cost
        3200. If a <strong>Legendary</strong> enchantment were added to the
        weapon, it would then cost 25,650. A true fortune!</p></section>

        <p><strong>Armor</strong> are items which can be worn to provide
        protection against attacks or environmental hazards. The Crucible system
        provides a framework and rules for creating and classifying Armor, and
        also provides an assortment of predefined Armor types which are typical
        to a fantasy role-playing setting. These Armors can be browsed in the
        Armor Compendium pack.</p><p>Armor in Crucible has the following
        attributes, in addition to properties shared by all
        items:</p><h4>Category</h4><p>The category of armor establishes certain
        parameters about how that armor is used. What is it's weight category?
        How much physical protection does it afford? How capable of nimble
        movement is someone while wearing it? Supported Armor categories are
        listed in a table below.</p><h4>Armor Defense</h4><p>Each piece of Armor
        provides a certain amount of Armor defense, bounded by the range allowed
        by its category. This Armor defense contributes directly towards
        Physical Defense when the item is equipped.</p><h4>Dodge
        Defense</h4><p>Each piece of Armor provides a baseline amount of Dodge
        defense, bounded by the range allowed by its category. This base Dodge
        defense contributes directly towards Physical Defense when the item is
        equipped.</p><h4>Dodge Scaling Threshold</h4><p>In addition to base
        Dodge defense, each piece of Armor can yield additional Dodge Defense
        depending on the wearer's Dexterity in excess of a certain Dodge Scaling
        Threshold.</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Defense</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">Armor Defense + Base Dodge +
        (Dexterity - Dodge Scaling Threshold)</p></section><section
        class="gameplay"><p>Scale Mail is medium armor which offers <strong>13
        Armor Defense</strong> and <strong>4 Base Dodge Defense</strong>. As
        Medium Armor, the effectiveness of Scale Mail will continue to improve
        if the wearer has more than <strong>4 Dexterity</strong>, it's
        <strong>Dodge Scaling Threshold</strong>. When Jex, a nimble Halfling
        fighter with 7 Dexterity, dons Scale Mail armor they benefit from a
        total Physical Defense of 20.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Armor
        Categories</h2><p>The following table lists the categories of Armor
        supported in the Crucible game system.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Armor

        Armor</strong> does not permit a free <strong>Move</strong> action each
        turn as other armor types do.</p><h2 class="divider">Quality
        Tier</h2><p><strong>Quality</strong> of Armor describes its
        craftsmanship, materials, and condition. Quality tiers provide an
        additional bonus to Armor defense and increase item rarity. The quality
        tier of Armor is established at its time of initial creation and can
        never be increased after that point.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Quality

        Armor</h4><p>During the course of use, or over the passage of time,
        Armor may become <strong>Broken</strong>. Armor which is Broken only
        benefits from half its normal Armor defense.</p><h2
        class="divider">Enchantment Tier</h2><p><strong>Enchantment</strong> of
        Armor describes its level of magical imbuement. Enchantment provides
        further increases to Armor defense and increases item rarity. Armor can
        be enchanted after its original creation or have its enchantment
        improved.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Enchantment Tier</th><th>Armor

        class="divider">Special Properties</h2><p>Some Armor may have one (or in
        very rare cases multiple) of the following special properties. Each of
        these properties adds a +1 Rarity modifier to the
        Armor.</p><h4>Bulky</h4><p>Armor that is <strong>Bulky</strong> is
        cumbersome to wield and conveys a penalty of +2 Banes to all Initiative
        rolls.</p><h4>Organic</h4><p>Armor that is <strong>Organic</strong> is
        physically part of the creature that "wears" it and such armor cannot be
        removed.</p>
