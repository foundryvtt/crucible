        <p><strong>Adversaries</strong> in Crucible are the non-player
        characters which populate and inhabit the world. Despite the name, not
        all adversaries are antagonistic in nature, we simply use the term
        "Adversary" to refer to non-player actors in the
        system.</p><p>Adversaries share most mechanical concepts in common with
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6.JournalEntryPage.DjePpoV2oJenlyTf]{Overview}
        (player characters) including Ability Scores, Resources, Defenses,
        Skills, Resistances, and Talents, but adversaries progress somewhat
        differently than player characters.</p><p><strong>Threat Level
        </strong>describes the degree of mechanical challenge posed by a certain
        Adversary and is defined by the product of <strong>Level</strong> and
        <strong>Threat Category</strong>. An adversaries attributes and
        difficulty scale with higher level and higher Threat
        Category.</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Threat
        Level</p><p class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">Level × Threat
        Multiplier</p></section><h2 class="divider">Threat
        Categories</h2><p>Each Threat Category contributes a multiplier to the
        effective <strong>Threat Level</strong> of the Adversary and also
        determines the number of
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c.JournalEntryPage.2U2k8WcnB1gbPLfd]{Action
        Points} that the Adversary has in combat. The Threat Categories in the
        Crucible system are:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Threat
        Category</th><th>Threat Multiplier</th><th>Action Points</th><th
        style="width:50%">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Minion</td><td>×
        0.5</td><td>2</td><td>Weaker than average foes at a given level, minions
        are less dangerous and more easily dispatched - but may be numerous in
        quantity.</td></tr><tr><td><p>Normal</p></td><td>×
        1</td><td>3</td><td>The standard level of difficulty and challenge for a
        certain level.</td></tr><tr><td>Elite</td><td>×
        1.5</td><td>4</td><td>Stronger than average foes at a given level,
        elites are more dangerous and more difficult to dispatch. Elites are
        more rarely encountered.</td></tr><tr><td>Boss</td><td>×
        2</td><td>5</td><td>Especially dangerous enemies which represent the
        ultimate degree of challenge at a certain level. Most encounters do not
        contain a boss.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class="divider">Attribute
        Scaling</h2><p>Where Protagonists feature an <strong>Ancestry</strong>
        and <strong>Background</strong>, instead Adversaries use the concepts of
        @UUID[.qSeJNy28eK9axO7C]{Taxonomy} and
        @UUID[.O8IesdQo8SQpIKbo]{Archetype}, both of which define how the
        attributes of the Adversary progress as it increases in Threat
        Level.</p><h2 class="divider">Adversary Talents</h2><p>Adversaries may
        be assigned additional Talents in addition to those automatically
        provided by their Archetype.</p><section
        class="construction"><p>Eventually there may be some rules limiting the
        number and tier of Talents that an Adversary may have, but for the time
        being it is acceptable for Adversaries to have any talents that the
        Gamemaster wishes to give them in addition to the Talents automatically
        provided by their Archetype.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Adversary
        Skills</h2><p>Adversaries share the same set of 12
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.CrucibleSkills00]{Skills}
        which are available to protagonist characters.</p><section
        class="construction"><p>For the initial Alpha Playtest - adversaries
        gain skill progression automatically. This is not envisioned as the long
        run solution for skill progression which will eventually be tied to
        Taxonomy and Archetype scaling.</p></section><h2
        class="divider">Defeating Adversaries</h2><p>Adversaries do not have
        <strong>Wounds</strong> or <strong>Madness</strong> pools like
        Protagonist characters, instead their ability to withstand harm is
        determined entirely by <strong>Health</strong> and
        <strong>Morale</strong>.</p><p>When an Adversary <strong>Health</strong>
        pool reaches zero it becomes <strong>Dead</strong>, and takes no further
        action during the encounter.</p><section class="construction"><p>It will
        eventually be possible to subdue an Adversary non-lethally, but these
        mechanics are not yet developed for Playtest One.</p></section><p>When
        Adversary <strong>Morale</strong> reaches zero it becomes
        <strong>Broken</strong>. A Broken Adversary will attempt to flee the
        battlefield unless they lack instincts of self-preservation or the
        possibility of escape seems impossible - in which case they will
        continue to fight to the death.</p>

        attributes and talents, but they would all share a common progression
        from their shared Hobgoblin Taxonomy.</p>

        <p><strong>Archetype</strong> defines the skills and combat style of an
        <strong>Adversary</strong> in Crucible. Each Archetype defines scaling

        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.gszlBVQ5fGh3y0I6.JournalEntryPage.RHCy135mF4EN1mWZ]{Abilities}

        which are automatically applied to Adversaries of that

        Archetype</h4><p>Hardened melee combatants expert at weilding one-handed
        weaponry, shield, and heavy armor.</p><p>The Fighter Archetype defines
        scaling weights such that emphasize faster progression of Strength and
        Toughness, normal progression of Presence and Dexterity, and slower
        progression of Wisdom and Intellect.</p><p>Furthermore, the Fighter

        Level 4 <strong>Hobgoblin Fighter</strong>, and a Level 7
        <strong>Hellguard</strong> all share the Fighter Archetype, but they
        each have different Taxonomies and therefore have different attributes
        and talents, but all share a common aspect of progression due to the
        Fighter Archetype.</p>
