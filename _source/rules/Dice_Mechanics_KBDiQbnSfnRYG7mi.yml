        <p>Crucible uses the standard set of role-playing game dice; relying
        upon 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided dice for various rolls. These dice
        are referred to as <strong>d4</strong>, <strong>d6</strong>,
        <strong>d8</strong>, <strong>d10</strong>, and <strong>d12</strong>,
        where a number that precedes the die type represents the quantity of
        that die to roll, for example <strong>4d6</strong> provides instruction
        to roll four six-sided dice.</p><blockquote><p>Crucible is designed
        specifically for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, but its dice mechanics are
        possible to play outside of a digital environment, albeit with a fairly
        high level of bookkeeping required.</p></blockquote><p>When your
        character performs heroic actions within the world, whether they be
        feats of martial prowess or clever social maneuvers, the outcomes of the
        attempted action are discovered by rolling dice.</p><h2
        class="divider">Standard Check</h2><p>The standard approach towards
        determining the outcome of a dice check in Crucible uses a dice pool
        comprised of three dice, typically 3d8, which are added together. The
        exact dice used in the pool are modified depending on the
        <strong>Boons</strong> or <strong>Banes</strong> which apply to the
        roll. Added to the result of these three dice are Ability, Skill, and
        Enchantment bonuses which further increase the value of the result. This
        type of dice roll is referred to as a <strong>Standard
        Check</strong>.</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Standard
        Check</p><p class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">3d8[Boons,Banes] +
        Ability Bonus + Skill Bonus + Enchantment Bonus</p></section>

        <blockquote><p>A goblin desperately thrusts at an armored human with its
        damaged, dull blade. An enchanter wishes to haggle with a merchant she
        has magically charmed. A soldier swings his hammer at the head of a
        dazed, concussed ogre. When performing a check, a character may find
        some favorable circumstances shift the odds in their favor. Other
        disadvantageous circumstances will hinder a character's odds of
        success.</p></blockquote><p>Circumstances which apply beneficial or
        detrimental forces upon the likelihood of a check being successful are
        represented as <strong>Boons</strong> and <strong>Banes</strong>,
        respectively. The number of boons and banes to be applied to a roll are
        determined before a roll is made, as they directly affect the
        composition of the dice pool that is used. A single dice pool roll can
        have no more than 6 boons and 6 banes affecting it.</p><h2
        class="divider">Boons</h2><p>Each <strong>Boon</strong> applied to the
        check increments the denomination of the first die in the pool by +2, to
        a maximum of <strong>d12</strong>. If a die is already a d12 due to
        other boons, the increase is applied to the next die in the pool. In
        practical terms, boons upgrade dice making them bigger and more
        effective.</p><h2 class="divider">Banes</h2><p>Each
        <strong>Bane</strong> applied to the check decrements the denomination
        of the last die in the pool by -2, to a minimum of <strong>d4</strong>.
        If a die is already a d4 due to other banes, the decrease is applied to
        the next die in the pool. In practical terms, banes downgrade dice
        making them smaller and less effective.</p><h2
        class="divider">Mitigating Circumstances</h2><p>Because boons and banes
        start at opposite ends of the dice pool, they can both affect changes to
        the same roll. For example, a check made with with 2 Boons and 2 Banes
        would result in a dice pool of <strong>1d12 + 1d8 + 1d4</strong>. If
        more than four Boons and more than four Banes are present their effects
        will begin to cancel each other out.</p><section
        class="gameplay"><h4>Example: Added Boons</h4><p>Suppose Albert, a naval
        captain, has his ship boarded by pirates. By fortunate circumstance, the
        fierce rocking of the ship has toppled one of the invaders over on the
        deck of his ship. Advancing towards the sprawling pirate, Albert draws
        his blade and slashes down upon the unwelcome guest. Attacking a Prone
        creature confers <strong>2 boons</strong> to Albert's attack
        roll.</p><p>These two boons upgrade the first die in the
        <strong>3d8</strong> dice pool twice, from a <strong>d8</strong> to a
        <strong>d12</strong>, resulting in a dice pool of <strong>1d12 + 1d8 +
        1d8</strong>.</p></section><p>Boons or banes resulting from
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c.JournalEntryPage.USjhhuOGsLTXQM9v]{Conditions}
        like <strong>Prone</strong> will be handled automatically by layers of
        automation in the Crucible software, but additional boons may always be
        awarded by the Gamemaster prior to any roll as ways to reward players
        for creative problem solving or inspirational roleplay.</p><section
        class="gameplay"><h4>Example: Both Boons and Banes</h4><p>Dariel is an
        intrepid outdoorswoman with the Journeyman rank in Survival with a
        Herbalist specialization. She wishes to identify a herb that may be used
        to treat poison after an arduous day of traveling. Her specialization as
        a Herbalist gives her <strong>1 Boon</strong> to the roll to identify
        the correct herb, but her state of exhaustion gives her <strong>2
        Banes</strong> to her roll. The boon upgrades the first die in the pool
        to a <strong>d10</strong>, and the two banes downgrade the third die to
        a <strong>d4</strong>, resulting in a dice pool of <strong>1d10 + 1d8 +
        1d4</strong>.</p></section><p>Mathematically, each Boon increases the
        expected result of its die by 1 and each Bane decreases the expected
        result of its die by 1.</p>
