        <p><strong>Schematics</strong> are items in Crucible which define the
        rules by which input items (often called "ingredients") are transformed
        into output items (often called "products") using the crafting system
        and its set of Trades@UUID[.tradeskillsOverv]{Tradeskills}.</p><h2
        class="divider">Schematic Definition</h2><p>Schematics have the
        following components:</p><dl><dt><p>Category</p></dt><dd><p>The category
        of a schematic defines which Tradeskill is required to manufacture
        it.</p></dd><dt><p>Inputs</p></dt><dd><p>Schematic inputs define a set
        of ingredients which are required in order to manufacture it.
        Ingredients can be specified in groups, with each group having a
        specific mode that customizes whether all ingredients in that group are
        required or only one of several options.</p><p>Additionally, each input
        group can require a certain amount of currency which represents minor
        ingredients or supplies inherent in the crafting attempt which are not
        individually enumerated as ingredient items.</p><p>Lastly, each input
        group specifies whether the ingredients in that group are consumed in
        the process of crafting or not. Note that even ingredients which are not
        ordinarily consumed during the process of crafting can become broken if
        the attempt results in a critical
        failure.</p></dd><dt><p>Outputs</p></dt><dd><p>Schematic outputs define
        the products which result from successful manufacturing of the
        schematic. A schematic can produce one or multiple outputs. In the event
        that multiple outputs are produced, the schematic can configure whether
        all of the outputs are obtained or only one of them.</p><p>If only one
        output is obtained, the schematic must define a number of alternative
        input groups which maps to the number of potential products. The input
        group used during crafting determines which product is
        obtained.</p></dd><dt><p>Quality</p></dt><dd><p>Schematics have a
        quality which defines the initial quality of outputs resulting from
        manufacture of the schematic. The final quality of outputs is also
        determined by the quality of ingredients used as well as the success
        tier on the corresponding crafting
        check.</p></dd><dt><p>Difficulty</p></dt><dd><p>Schematics define a
        difficulty threshold (DC) which specifies the value that a crafting
        check must exceed in order to result in a successful
        outcome.</p></dd><dt><p>Hours</p></dt><dd><p>Schematics specify the
        number of hours required to complete manufacture. These hours must be
        performed consecutively without interruption. For especially
        long-duration crafting endeavors any amount of required resting time
        should be included in this number.</p></dd></dl><h2
        class="divider">Obtaining Schematics</h2><p>Schematics are generally
        obtained during the course of adventure by finding them within the world
        or obtaining them from other characters. Each schematic, like all
        physical items, has a base price which is further scaled according to
        its quality level. This price is used when purchasing or selling
        schematics in trade with non-player characters.</p><section
        class="foundryvtt"><p>There are a number of schematics provided by the
        core Crucible system. These system-provided schematics can be found in
        the <strong>Crucible ➤ Items ➤ Schematics</strong> compendium
        pack.</p><p>Gamemasters can define their own schematics which can be
        awarded to characters directly or placed into an ancillary compendium
        pack which makes them available for use in crafting.</p><p>Custom
        compendium packs of schematics can be assigned under <strong>Configure
        Settings ➤ Crucible ➤ Configure Compendium
        Sources</strong>.</p><p></p></section><h2 class="divider">Learning
        Schematics</h2><p>Schematics provide detailed instructions for the
        creation process of their outputs. Manufacturing an item requires the
        crafter to either physically possess the schematic, have mastered it, or
        for the schematic to be classified as "common
        knowledge".</p><p>Schematics are mastered by completing their crafting
        process with a result of a critical success. Once a schematic has been
        mastered it is no longer physically required in order to repeat its
        process.</p>

        <p></p><p><strong>Crafting</strong> in Crucible is performed using a set
        of <strong>Tradeskills</strong> which, similar to adventuring
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.characterMechani.JournalEntryPage.skills0000000000]{Skills},
        are invested aspects of your character's identity obtained through
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.characterMechani.JournalEntryPage.talents000000000]{Talent}
        progression and through the accumulation of knowledge in the form of
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.crucibleCrafting.JournalEntryPage.schematicDefinit]{Schematics}.</p><section
        class="construction"><p>Crucible's crafting system is currently in early
        development, rules written here are subject to change and many details
        may not yet be finished. Please consider these details a preview of
        things to come.</p></section><section class="gameplay"><p>It is not
        required for any character to invest into mastery of a tradeskill,
        however it is generally recommended to select at least one tradeskill to
        pursue in order to enjoy a well-rounded experience playing Crucible,
        particularly if your game is a long-form campaign.</p></section><p>The
        information in this journal describes each of the tradeskills, how
        schematics are defined and obtained, and how the crafting process
        functions when using a schematic to turn input ingredients into produced
        items.</p><h2 class="divider">Tradeskills
