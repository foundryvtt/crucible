        <p><strong>Ability Scores</strong> approximate facets of a character's
        physical and mental capability. All dice checks in the Crucible system
        are modified by at least one ability score of the character performing
        the test.</p><p>The values of each Ability Score range from
        <strong>1</strong> to <strong>12</strong>, where the typical value of
        this attribute for a non-remarkable Human is <strong>2</strong>. A score
        of 1 typically indicates an area of weakness compared to one's peers
        while an ability score of 12 is reserved for supernatural entities,
        great beasts, or heroes who are unparalleled in their power.</p><p>Some
        adversaries may have a score of <strong>0</strong> in a particular
        ability score. This convention is used when a particular ability is not
        applicable for that particular creature. The ability scores used in the
        Crucible system are:</p><h4>Strength</h4><p>Describes physical potency,
        brawn and might. Strength affects Health, use of melee weaponry,
        Fortitude defense, and carrying
        capacity.</p><h4>Dexterity</h4><p>Describes physical agility and
        precision. Dexterity affects the use of precision weapons, Dodge
        defense, Initiative in taking action, and Reflex
        defense.</p><h4>Toughness</h4><p>Describes physical hardiness and
        resilience. Toughness affects Health and Fortitude
        defense.</p><h4>Wisdom</h4><p>Describes mental potency, depth and
        breadth of knowledge. Wisdom influences Morale, Focus Points, and
        Willpower Defense.</p><h4>Intellect</h4><p>Describes mental flexibility,
        swiftness, and precision of thought. Intellect influences Initiative in
        taking action and Reflex defense.</p><h4>Presence</h4><p>Describes
        mental hardiness, emotional hardiness, charm, and personality. Presence
        influences Morale, Willpower defense, and Focus Points.</p>

        <p><strong>Ancestry</strong> classifies the biology and physiology of a
        character in Crucible. Fantasy settings may feature a spectrum of
        species which are playable as characters. Crucible supports defining
        Ancestries for each of these options which are narratively and
        mechanically appropriate for your own game.</p><p>Traits of ancestries
        inform physical appearance or biological characteristics, apply small
        changes to a character's initial @UUID[.RHCy135mF4EN1mWZ]{Ability
        Scores}, and alter the character's @UUID[.XDx0e2rZWcHLcfBt]{Resistance
        and Vulnerability} to damage.</p><h4>Starting Ability Scores</h4><p>The
        first step of character creation is selecting an Ancestry. Each Ancestry
        provides a primary Ability score which begins at <strong>3</strong>, and
        a secondary ability score which begins at <strong>2</strong>. All other
        ability scores begin at <strong>1</strong>.</p><h4>Damage Resistance and
        Vulnerability</h4><p>Ancestries may optionally add both a Damage
        Resistance (<strong>+3</strong>) and a Damage Vulnerability
        (<strong>-3</strong>) to two different damage types. Some Ancestries
        have neither Resistance nor Vulnerability to any damage
        type.</p><h4>Ancestral Talents</h4><section class="construction"><p>We
        intend for Ancestries to each have an initial ancestral Talent; a
        special talent that is not otherwise available on the Talent Tree which
        is unique to that Ancestry. This is not implemented for Playtest
        1.</p></section><h2>Creating Ancestries</h2><p>Crucible is not designed
        for a specific game setting. Gamemasters are encouraged to create or
        modify Ancestries to fit the lore of their own worlds. To configure an
        Ancestry in Crucible, create a new <strong>Item</strong> with the
        <strong>Ancestry</strong> type. Fill out the Ancestry configuration
        sheet to select a primary Ability score, a secondary Ability score, and
        optionally Resistance and Vulnerability to two different damage types.
        Every Ancestry may either have both a Resistance and a Vulnerability, or
        neither.</p><h2>Example Ancestries</h2><p>Crucible provides the
        following Ancestries for the purposes of playtesting which are familiar
        to typical fantasy role-playing settings. A collection of sample
        ancestries which are provided for the initial playtest are presented in
        the following table:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Ancestry</th><th>Primary

        Biological traits do not guarantee physical attributes, nor are species
        meant to be homogenous or monolithic (unless narratively intended).
        Gamemasters are empowered and encouraged to modify or customize

        Consider Ancestral traits as suggestions rather than
        requirements.</p><section class="gameplay"><p>Alex (a player) intends to
        roleplay as an Orc who, at the beginning of their journey, is not
        particularly tough but instead unusually wise. In such cases the initial
        Ability Scores of <strong>3 Strength</strong> and <strong>2
        Toughness</strong> that the example Orcish Ancestry provides are at odds
        with the character development Alex desires. The Gamemaster can work
        with Alex to create a variation of the Orcish ancestry which offers
        different starting Ability Scores, for example by swapping the Primary
        Ability from Strength to Wisdom.</p></section>

        <p><strong>Protagonists</strong> are the characters in Crucible which
        are controlled and portrayed by players, also known as "player
        characters". All Protagonists, even those at Level 1, are capable
        adventurers. They are smart, charismatic, athletic, and skillful - but
        not yet to a degree that is wondrous. As characters advance in level
        they attain tiers of power where their physical, mental, and social
        capabilities are truly legendary. Character advancement in Crucible is
        level-based. Increases in level grant additional Ability, Skill, and
        Talent points to spend which increase a character's power and
        capabilities. The maximum character level in Crucible is anticipated to
        be <strong>18</strong>.</p><p>If organizing a gameplay experience that
        seeks to tell the origin story of heroes, starting your game at Level 1
        is the recommended choice. If, however, you want to jump into an
        adventure with characters who are already established champions,
        beginning at a higher level may be more suitable.</p><blockquote><p>If
        starting at a higher level than 1, we recommend each player prepare a
        set of short anecdotes which explain the skill and talent advancements
        that their character has unlocked prior to the start of the game. This
        process helps to solidify their character backstory through past events
        that explain their heroic capabilities.</p></blockquote><p>Character
        creation is an easy six-step process described below. During creation, a
        character is considered to be "Level Zero" when they are allowed to make
        initial choices about their hero. Once the creation process is
        completed, the hero advances to Level 1.</p><h2 class="divider">Step 1 -
        Ancestry and Background</h2><p>The initial character creation process
        involves choosing one @UUID[.ovqgeiXHPrdiUXci]{Ancestry} and one
        @UUID[.uCwStnXHoUCV2TrK]{Background} which help to establish the
        character's backstory and starting attributes. To browse the provided
        options for playtest Ancestry or Background you can click the plus icon
        next to <strong>Choose Ancestry</strong> or <strong>Choose
        Background</strong>, or create your own custom option from scratch as a
        new <strong>Item</strong>. To add an Ancestry or Background to your
        sheet just drag and drop the item onto your character sheet.</p><section
        class="foundryvtt"><p>You can clear an added Ancestry or Background by
        clicking the <strong>x</strong> icon at the top of the sheet, but you
        may only do this if you have not yet advanced further to Step 2 or
        beyond.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Step 2 - Spend Ability
        Points</h2><p>In addition to starting Ability score values provided by
        your Ancestry, each character begins with <strong>9 Ability
        Points</strong> which can be allocated towards any of the
        six@UUID[.RHCy135mF4EN1mWZ]{Ability Scores}. These Ability Scores are
        used to calculate a number of secondary attributes for your character,
        such as @UUID[.alkVSDmt0ec5HBfE]{Defenses} and
        @UUID[.FmmADsI9qo1uIIT3]{Resource} pools.</p><section
        class="foundryvtt"><p>To spend Ability Points click the up or down
        arrows to the right of the desired Ability. When you have spent all 9
        points, the Abilities section becomes locked to prevent further editing,
        but you can unlock this section by clicking the section lock toggle
        button.</p></section><p>You may only increase a single Ability Score a
        maximum of 3 times during character creation. A counter at the top of
        the Abilities section displays how many points you have remaining to
        spend.</p><p>Once you have advanced your character to <strong>Level
        1</strong> the starting ability scores which you purchased can no longer
        be changed, but these ability scores may still be increased over time as
        you continue to level up.</p><h2 class="divider">Step 3 - Spend Skill
        Points</h2><p>Each character can invest into 12 different
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.CrucibleSkills00.JournalEntryPage.QQaQfv1cakIKltNz]{Skills}
        which represent various competencies and techniques that your character
        has mastered. Every character will begin with four Skill ranks which
        were provided by their Ancestry and Background. Additionally, each
        character begins with two Skill points which are further invested into
        Skills of the player's choosing. The cost to advance your rank in a
        Skill is described in the Character Skills documentation, but is
        automatically calculated when you add or remove ranks.</p><h2
        class="divider">Step 4 - Spend Talent Points</h2><p>Each new character
        has 2 initial
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.veKSDiOWHLaF7Gok.JournalEntryPage.OmJNyYrgeaTwYE7L]{Talent}
        points which can be used to select powerful abilities that character can
        perform. Talents are a roadmap for your character's development,
        allowing you to invest into unique paths that provide powerful
        abilities.</p><h2 class="divider">Step 5 - Acquire Starting
        Equipment</h2><p>The final step of character creation is to acquire
        starting
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.e33DSvx0cfa7fey6.JournalEntryPage.6QxbcLoOhUkXTbAj]{Equipment}
        appropriate for your character level.</p><section
        class="construction"><p>Specific rules for starting equipment are still
        a work in progress. For Playtest 1 start with any equipment you desire
        from the Armor or Weapons compendium packs. Note that you must mark your
        items as equipped in order for them to take effect on your character
        sheet.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Step 6 - Advancing to Level
        One</h2><p>Once you have chosen Ancestry and Background, spend initial
        Ability Points, invested into Skills and Talents, and acquired starting
        equipment your character advances to level 1. Advancing past level zero
        is a "point of no return", your initial choices become locked and may
        not be changed. Have no fear, there will be ample opportunities to
        continue growing your character as you further advance in level.</p>

        <p><strong>Resources </strong>refers to the family of attributes which
        represent a character's wellbeing and ability to act. Each resource is a
        "pool", featuring a current and maximum value. The minimum value for all
        resources is zero.</p><h2 class="divider">Physical and Mental
        Health</h2><p>Maintaining the physical and mental health of your
        character is an ever-present challenge. Crucible uses two separate pools
        to represent the hero's state of wellbeing.</p><h4>Health and
        Wounds</h4><p>The physical health of a character is modeled using two
        resource pools. <strong>Health</strong> is a temporary resource which
        begins full and is decreased when a character sustains damage in combat.
        <strong>Wounds</strong> are a permanent resource which increase when a
        character suffers greivous injury.</p><p>If the Health pool is reduced
        to zero, the character becomes <strong>Incapacitated</strong> and begins
        to suffer Wounds. If the Wounds meter reaches its maximum, the character
        becomes <strong>Dead</strong>.</p><h4>Morale and Madness</h4><p>The
        mental health of a character is similarly modeled using two resource
        pools. <strong>Morale</strong> is a temporary resource which begins full
        and is decreased as the character suffers stress or trauma.
        <strong>Madness</strong> is a permanent resource which increases when a
        character suffers greivous mental strain.</p><p>If the Morale pool is
        reduced to zero, the character becomes <strong>Broken</strong> and
        begins to suffer Madness. If the Madness meter reaches its maximum, the
        character becomes <strong>Insane</strong>.</p><h2
        class="divider">Capacity for Action</h2><p>Two resource pools define a
        character's ability to take action during game
        situations.</p><h4>Action</h4><p><strong>Action </strong>describes a
        character's capacity for rapid action during each round of a combat
        encounter. Characters typically have a pool of 6 Action, all six of
        which replenish at the start of their turn in
        combat.</p><h4>Focus</h4><p><strong>Focus</strong> describes a
        character's capacity for extraordinary feats of heroism or magic. A
        character's Focus is replenished when they successfully rest, but during
        the midst of combat Focus must be used thoughtfully as it will not
        naturally replenish.</p><h4>Heroism</h4><p><strong>Heroism</strong> is a
        special generated resource that allows you to perform spectacular feats
        of magic or heroic prowess. Heroism is earned over the course of —
        typically longer — combat encounters allowing you to narratively unleash
        your most powerful abilities once the tension of battle has
        peaked!</p><h2 class="divider">Recovering Resources</h2><p>During
        Combat, Health and Morale may only be recovered by Actions or Talents
        which provide <strong>Restoration</strong>. Outside of Combat, it is
        possible to use the <strong>Recover</strong> action which consumes 10
        minutes of time and fully replenishes your Health, Morale, Action, and
        Focus pools.</p><p>In order to reduce the accumulation of Wounds or
        Madness, long-term <strong>Rest</strong> is required. Rest mechanics are
        not implemented in Playtest One. The means and rate at which Wounds and
        Madness are reduced will be more fully articulated in a later phase of
        development.</p>

        <p><strong>Damage Resistance</strong> allows a character in Crucible to
        shrug off or succumb to more damage than normal. Specific creature types
        may be vulnerable to certain types of damage, conversely some of the
        most terrifying adversaries are ones that can ignore significant
        portions of damage that they take.</p><blockquote><p>Most creatures
        which are resistant to a certain damage type are vulnerable to some
        other damage type - if you encounter a creature which is overly
        effective at withstanding your blows - switch
        tactics!</p></blockquote><h2>Damage Types</h2><p>The Crucible system
        uses the following 12 <strong>Damage Types</strong>, each of which has a
        corresponding <strong>Resistance</strong> or
        <strong>Vulnerability</strong>. Additionally, each damage type has an
        associated
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.QhZgmBrdLAGwYy5c.JournalEntryPage.USjhhuOGsLTXQM9v]{Condition}
        which can be caused as a consequence of that damage type, usually as a
        result of a <strong>Critical
        Hit</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Physical Damage
        Types</p></th><th><p>Related
        Conditions</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Bludgeoning</p></td><td><p>Concussed</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Piercing</p></td><td><p>Bleeding</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Slashing</p></td><td><p>Bleeding</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Poison</p></td><td><p>Poisoned</p></td></tr><tr><th><p>Elemental

        and Maximum Damage</h2><p>When an Action deals damage as an immediate
        consequence (called "direct damage") the minimum amount of damage that
        can be dealt is 1, even if the creature has Resistance that exceeds the
        amount of damage dealt.</p><p>Some actions cause a downstream effect
        which deals damage upon a later Turn of combat (called "damage over
        time"). Damage over time can be completely negated by resistance; the
        minimum damage in such cases is zero.</p><p>When a creature is
        vulnerable to a type of damage dealt, the amount of damage dealt is
        increased by the amount of the vulnerability. This increase in damage is
        limited by the base amount of damage dealt; maximum damage against a
        vulnerable target is two times the amount of damage dealt.</p><section
        class="gameplay"><h4>Example: Damage Vulnerability</h4><p>Suppose a
        volatile Fire Elemental has vulnerability of <strong>-20</strong> to
        Cold damage. If the elemental is dealt <strong>7</strong> Cold damage
        before vulnerability is applied, the total result will be
        <strong>14</strong> Cold damage.</p></section>

        <p>Each time you gain a character level after level 1 you can further
        advance your character's powers and capabilities. Each level grants
        you:</p><ul><li>1 Ability Point which can increase one of your Ability
        scores by one.</li><li>2 Skill Points which can be used to purchase
        additional ranks in Skills.</li><li>2 Talent Points which can be used to
        purchase new character Talents.</li></ul><p>After gaining a level you
        should take a moment to invest these points so that you are prepared to
        face more challenging and heroic tasks. There are two recommended
        options for gamemasters in Crucible to award additional levels of
        experience to player characters.</p><h4>Encounter-Based
        Progression</h4><p>For a structured gameplay experience, Crucible
        assumes an encounter-based progression system where each character
        requires a certain number of successful encounter completions in order
        to advance to the next level.</p><p>The number of completed encounters
        required in order to advance to the next character level is equal to two
        times the next character level. To advance from level 1 to level 2
        requires the completion of 4 encounters. To advance to level 3 requires
        6 encounters, and so on.</p><section class="formula"><p
        class="value">Encounters To Level</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">(Level + 1) × 2</p></section><p>Encounter completion is
        not reserved only for combat encounters, navigating social challenges,
        completing significant quests, exploration of uncharted territory, or
        solving a mystery are all examples of actions which at the gamemaster's
        discretion can be awarded to players as a completed encounter.</p><p>In
        the case of combat encounters, specifically, such encounters only count
        towards a character's progression if the <strong>Encounter
        Level</strong> (EL) of the combat exceeds that character's current
        level. Adventurers must tackle increasingly difficult challenges if they
        wish to progress.</p><p>Not all encounters qualify for progression. If
        an encounter has too low an encounter level - in other words if it is
        too easy to overcome - it does not count towards character
        progression.</p><section class="construction"><p>The rules for computing
        Encounter Level are still a work in progress and are not included in
        Playtest 1.</p></section><h4>Milestone-Based
        Progression</h4><p>Milestone-based progression can be utilized as a more
        lightweight alternative to encounter-based progression in which it is
        left to the gamemaster to determine when a character has accomplished a
        significant feat that is deserving of advancement. This can be
        structured around the completion of quest objectives, the arrival of
        significant plot moments, or the vanquishing of notable foes.</p><p>When
        using Milestone based progression it is left to the Gamemaster to decide
        when the characters' deeds are deserving of level
        advancement.</p><blockquote><p>You can apply the concept of Milestone
        progression while still using the rules for Encounter-based advancement
        by ignoring Encounter Level and instead awarding a number of advancement
        points that you feel are appropriate upon the completion of any
        meaningful challenge.</p></blockquote>

        <p><strong>Defenses</strong> are a set of attributes for each character
        which define how difficult certain actions are to take against that
        character. The higher a defense value, the harder it is to perform an
        action which targets that defense. Success on a test against a defense
        target requires the roll to exceed the defense value, the defender is
        successful on a tie.</p><p>The defense types in the Crucible system
        are:</p><h2 class="divider">Physical Defense</h2><p><strong>Physical
        Defense</strong> describes how difficult the creature is to hit with
        physical attacks, typically melee or ranged weapon strikes. Physical
        Defense is composed of four components. Total Physical Defense is equal
        to:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Physical Defense</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">Armor + Dodge + Parry +
        Block</p></section><p>When an attack misses because it is less than or
        equal to the Physical Defense total, it is assigned a type of miss based
        on the proportional mixture of Physical Defense
        components.</p><h4>Armor</h4><p>Protection offered by worn equipment or
        organic attributes like scales or chitin. Strikes which fail to hit and
        are defended by Armor assume the <strong>Deflected</strong> outcome.
        Unlike other physical defense outcomes, Deflection still results in some
        damage as long as the attack roll was not a Critical Failure; more than
        6 less than the Physical Defense target. The residual damage dealt from
        a Deflection is also called a <strong>Glancing
        Blow.</strong></p><h4>Dodge</h4><p>Protection offered by physical
        quickness and agility. Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the
        Dodge defense assume the <strong>Dodged</strong> outcome. Dodged attacks
        deal no damage and provide opportunity for dodge-based
        reactions.</p><h4>Parry</h4><p>Protection offered by guarding against an
        attack using an equipped weapon. Strikes which fail to hit and are
        defended by the Parry defense assume the <strong>Parried</strong>
        outcome. Parried attacks deal no damage and provide opportunity for
        parry-based reactions.</p><h4>Block</h4><p>Protection offered by
        guarding against an attack using an equipped shield or blocking weapon.
        Strikes which fail to hit and are defended by the Block defense assume
        the <strong>Blocked </strong>outcome. Blocked attacks deal no damage and
        provide opportunity for block-based reactions.</p><h2
        class="divider">Non-Physical Defenses</h2><p>The three non-physical
        defenses are used to protect against spells or other abilities which are
        non-corporeal or intangible in
        nature.</p><h4>Fortitude</h4><p><strong>Fortitude Defense</strong>
        describes a character's ability to withstand bodily harm. Fortitude is
        modified by <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Wisdom</strong> which
        represent physical resistance and mental resilience respectively.
        Fortitude defense is calculated as:</p><section class="formula"><p
        class="value">Fortitude Defense</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">12 + Strength + Wisdom +
        Bonus</p></section><h4>Willpower</h4><p><strong>Willpower
        Defense</strong> describes a character's ability to withstand mental or
        emotional attacks. Willpower is modified by <strong>Toughness</strong>
        and <strong>Presence</strong> which represent physical grit and mental
        determination respectively. Willpower defense is calculated
        as:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Willpower Defense</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + Toughness + Presence +
        Bonus</p></section><h4>Reflex</h4><p><strong>Reflex Defense</strong>
        describes a character's ability to avoid harm that would otherwise occur
        in a specific area. Reflex is modified by <strong>Dexterity</strong> and
        <strong>Intellect</strong> which represent quickness of body and
        rapidity of thought respectively. Reflex defense is calculated
        as:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Reflex Defense</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + Dexterity + Intellect +
        Bonus</p></section><p>Note that Reflex is typically used as the defense
        type for intangible - but otherwise physical - sources of harm, while
        Physical Defense is used to defend against tangible
        attacks.</p><h4>Defense Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these non-physical
        defenses may be obtained through Talents or magical Equipment. Adversary
        creatures have a -2 penalty to these defenses to compensate for their
        comparatively advantaged Ability score progression. This penalty
        increases for Adversaries with threat level below 1.</p><h2
        class="divider">Restoration Thresholds</h2><p><strong>Restoration
        Thresholds</strong> describe a pair of defenses which dictate how
        challenging it is to restore a creature's resources through healing or
        rallying actions.</p><h4>Healing Threshold</h4><p><strong>Healing
        Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Health
        of a creature. As creatures become more severely wounded, they grow more
        difficult to heal. This provides a measure of attrition which requires
        adventures to carefully manage their accumulation of <strong>Wounds
        </strong>over time. Healing threshold is calculated as:</p><section
        class="formula"><p class="value">Healing Threshold</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + (Wounds / 10) -
        Bonus</p></section><h4>Rallying Threshold</h4><p><strong>Rallying
        Threshold</strong> describes how difficult it is to restore the Morale
        of a creature. As creatures become more psychologically damaged they
        become more difficult to rally. This provides a measure of attrition
        which requires adventurers to carefully manage their accumulation of
        <strong>Madness</strong> over time. Rallying threshold is calculated
        as:</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Rallying
        Threshold</p><p class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">12 + (Madness /
        10) - Bonus</p></section><h4>Threshold Bonuses</h4><p>Bonuses to these
        Restoration Threshold defenses may be obtained through Talents or
        magical Equipment. Since higher thresholds make a character more
        difficult to heal, bonuses to these defenses lower the threshold instead
        of increasing it.</p>
