        <p>The first step in character creation is selecting an
        <strong>Ancestry</strong>, which classifies the biology and physiology
        of a character in Crucible, and grants the newly created hero specific
        starting traits.</p><p>You can change your character's Ancestry at any
        point during the character creation, but be aware that doing so may
        impact your currently assigned Ability Scores if you have already chosen
        them and that may require re-selecting them before completing your
        character creation.</p><p>For more information see:
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.characterMechani.JournalEntryPage.ancestry00000000]</p><p>Each
        Ancestry includes:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>Primary Ability</strong>
        Score (which begins at 3)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Secondary
        Ability</strong> Score (which begins at 2)</p></li><li><p>A
        <strong>Size</strong> value in grid spaces (typically
        4)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Stride</strong> value in grid spaces that
        determines the starting movement speed (typically 10)</p></li><li><p>An
        <strong>Ancestral Talent </strong>which grants a specific special

        <strong>1</strong>. The values of each Ability Score range from

        provided by your Ancestry, each character begins with <strong>9 Ability

        up.</p><p>For more information see:</p>

        <p><strong>Heroes</strong> are the characters in Crucible which are
        controlled and portrayed by players, also known as "player characters".
        All Heroes, even those at Level 1, are capable adventurers. They are
        smart, charismatic, athletic, and skillful - but not yet to a degree
        that is wondrous. As characters advance in level they attain tiers of
        power where their physical, mental, and social capabilities are truly
        legendary. Character advancement in Crucible is level-based. Increases
        in level grant additional Ability, Skill, and Talent points to spend
        which increase a character's power and capabilities. The maximum
        character level in Crucible is anticipated to be
        <strong>18</strong>.</p><p>If organizing a gameplay experience that
        seeks to tell the origin story of heroes, starting your game at Level 1
        is the recommended choice. If, however, you want to jump into an
        adventure with characters who are already established champions,
        beginning at a higher level may be more suitable.</p><blockquote><p>If
        starting at a higher level than 1, we recommend each player prepare a
        set of short anecdotes which explain the skill and talent advancements
        that their character has unlocked prior to the start of the game. This
        process helps to solidify their character backstory through past events
        that explain their heroic capabilities.</p></blockquote><p>Character
        creation is an easy process described below, though additional games
        using the Crucible system may add their own additional steps. During
        creation, a character is considered to be "Level Zero" when they are
        allowed to make initial choices about their hero. Once the creation
        process is completed, the hero advances to Level 1. You may reset the
        character creation process at any time by clicking the "restart" button
        located at the top right of the character creation
        screen.</p><p></p><h2>Character Creation

        <p>Each time you gain a character level after level 1 you can further
        advance your character's powers and capabilities. Each level grants
        you:</p><ul><li>1 Ability Point which can increase one of your Ability
        scores by one.</li><li>2 Talent Points which can be used to purchase new
        character Talents.</li></ul><p>After gaining a level you should take a
        moment to invest these points so that you are prepared to face more
        challenging and heroic tasks. There are two recommended options for
        gamemasters in Crucible to award additional levels of experience to
        player characters.</p><h4>Milestone-Based
        Progression</h4><p>Milestone-based progression leaves it to the
        gamemaster to determine when characters have accomplished a significant
        feat that is deserving of advancement. This can be structured around the
        completion of quest objectives, the arrival of significant plot moments,
        or the vanquishing of notable foes. Awarding progression based on
        milestones allows the GM to specifically grant levels as milestones are
        accomplished.</p><p>Crucible facilitates the convenient marking of
        milestones through the Group Actor sheet, which allows the GM to add
        group members to the sheet by dragging them from the Actor sidebar.
        After a group has been formed, clicking the center of the hex for
        Milestones Earned raises an award prompt, allowing the GM to quickly add
        an identified milestone, amount of award, and reason for the milestone
        being awarded. When awarding a milestone through this method, the GM may
        also selectively grant the milestone only to particular group
        members.</p>

        <p><strong>Talents</strong> are unique abilities or skills that your

        your newly created Actor Sheet will open. It can be accessed at any time
        from the Actors tab or by pressing the C key on your keyboard (if you
        have assigned the character to yourself via Player Configuration)</p>

        <p>While character creation is technically finished once the "Complete"
        button has been pressed, there are a few details you may wish to add to
        your character:</p><h3>Starting Equipment</h3><p>Choosing starting
        equipment is an important part of beginning any adventure. We advise
        Gamemasters to work closely with their players to determine what basic
        equipment they feel is appropriate for each character by browsing the
        existing Equipment compendium (found on the compendium tab in the Items
        folder). Dragging items from this compendium onto your newly created
        Actor Sheet will assign the item to that Actor's Inventory.</p><p>A
        level 1 character should not have more than <strong>35pp
        (350gp)</strong> worth of items and equipment.</p><p>A level 1 character
        should not start with any enchanted items.</p><p>It is important that
        when adding character equipment you mark anything that the character is
        wearing as equipped by clicking on the Equip button on the right hand
        side of the sheet next to the edit and delete buttons.</p><section
        class="foundryvtt"><p>While Crucible includes a number of example Items,
        Gamemasters can create and use their own custom Items either through the
        sidebar tab (for items that will be used by many characters) or by
        clicking the + icon on the bottom right corner of any Actor's inventory
        tab for more unique, character-specific
        items.</p></section><h3>Appearance and Details</h3><p>With character
        creation finished, it's a good idea to choose a picture to represent
        your character by clicking on the icon of the hooded figure on the upper
        left corner of the actor sheet. In addition, on the Biography tab, you
        can fill in some important details such as Pronouns, Age, Height,
        Weight, and provide a physical description to accompany your
        hero.</p><h3>Biographies</h3><p>As a final piece of character creation,
        you might wish to provide a Public Biography that other players in your
        game will be able to see, containing some facts about your hero's
        reputation and history. Any details in the Private Biography section
        will only be shown to you and your gamemaster, making it a useful place
        to write your hero's complete backstory.</p>
