        <p>The first step in character creation is selecting an
        <strong>Ancestry</strong>, which classifies the biology and physiology
        of a character in Crucible, and grants the newly created hero specific
        starting traits.</p><p>You can change your character's Ancestry at any
        point during the character creation, but be aware that doing so may
        impact your currently assigned Ability Scores if you have already chosen
        them and that may require re-selecting them before completing your
        character creation.</p><p>For more information see:
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.characterMechani.JournalEntryPage.ancestry00000000]</p><p>Each
        Ancestry includes:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>Primary Ability</strong>
        Score (which begins at 3)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Secondary
        Ability</strong> Score (which begins at 2)</p></li><li><p>A
        <strong>Size</strong> value in grid spaces (typically
        4)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Stride</strong> value in grid spaces that
        determines the starting movement speed (typically 10)</p></li><li><p>An
        <strong>Ancestral Talent </strong>which grants a specific special

        this attribute for a non-remarkable Human is
        <strong>2</strong>.</p><p>In addition to starting Ability Score values
        provided by your Ancestry, each character begins with <strong>9 Ability

        remaining to spend.</p><p>Once you have completed character creation and
        advanced your character to <strong>Level 1</strong> the starting Ability
        Scores which you purchased can no longer be changed, but these ability
        scores may still be increased over time as you continue to level
        up.</p><p>For more information see: </p>

        <p><strong>Heroes</strong> are the characters in Crucible which are
        controlled and portrayed by players, also known as "player characters".
        All Heroes, even those at Level 1, are capable adventurers. They are
        smart, charismatic, athletic, and skillful - but not yet to a degree
        that is wondrous. As characters advance in level they attain tiers of
        power where their physical, mental, and social capabilities are truly
        legendary. Character advancement in Crucible is level-based. Increases
        in level grant additional Ability, Skill, and Talent points to spend
        which increase a character's power and capabilities. The maximum
        character level in Crucible is anticipated to be
        <strong>18</strong>.</p><p>If organizing a gameplay experience that
        seeks to tell the origin story of heroes, starting your game at Level 1
        is the recommended choice. If, however, you want to jump into an
        adventure with characters who are already established champions,
        beginning at a higher level may be more suitable.</p><blockquote><p>If
        starting at a higher level than 1, we recommend each player prepare a
        set of short anecdotes which explain the skill and talent advancements
        that their character has unlocked prior to the start of the game. This
        process helps to solidify their character backstory through past events
        that explain their heroic capabilities.</p></blockquote><p>Character
        creation is an easy three-step process described below. During creation,
        a character is considered to be "Level Zero" when they are allowed to
        make initial choices about their hero. Once the creation process is
        completed, the hero advances to Level 1. You may reset the character
        creation process at any time by clicking the "restart" button located at
        the top right of the character creation screen.</p><p></p><h2>Character

        <p>Each time you gain a character level after level 1 you can further
        advance your character's powers and capabilities. Each level grants
        you:</p><ul><li>1 Ability Point which can increase one of your Ability
        scores by one.</li><li>2 Skill Points which can be used to purchase
        additional ranks in Skills.</li><li>2 Talent Points which can be used to
        purchase new character Talents.</li></ul><p>After gaining a level you
        should take a moment to invest these points so that you are prepared to
        face more challenging and heroic tasks. There are two recommended
        options for gamemasters in Crucible to award additional levels of
        experience to player characters.</p><h4>Encounter-Based
        Progression</h4><p>For a structured gameplay experience, Crucible
        assumes an encounter-based progression system where each character
        requires a certain number of successful encounter completions in order
        to advance to the next level.</p><p>The number of completed encounters
        required in order to advance to the next character level is equal to two
        times the next character level. To advance from level 1 to level 2
        requires the completion of 4 encounters. To advance to level 3 requires
        6 encounters, and so on.</p><section class="formula"><p
        class="value">Encounters To Level</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">(Level + 1) × 2</p></section><p>Encounter completion is
        not reserved only for combat encounters, navigating social challenges,
        completing significant quests, exploration of uncharted territory, or
        solving a mystery are all examples of actions which at the gamemaster's
        discretion can be awarded to players as a completed encounter.</p><p>In
        the case of combat encounters, specifically, such encounters only count
        towards a character's progression if the <strong>Encounter
        Level</strong> (EL) of the combat exceeds that character's current
        level. Adventurers must tackle increasingly difficult challenges if they
        wish to progress.</p><p>Not all encounters qualify for progression. If
        an encounter has too low an encounter level - in other words if it is
        too easy to overcome - it does not count towards character
        progression.</p><section class="construction"><p>The rules for computing
        Encounter Level are still a work in progress and are not included in
        Playtest 1.</p></section><h4>Milestone-Based
        Progression</h4><p>Milestone-based progression can be utilized as a more
        lightweight alternative to encounter-based progression in which it is
        left to the gamemaster to determine when a character has accomplished a
        significant feat that is deserving of advancement. This can be
        structured around the completion of quest objectives, the arrival of
        significant plot moments, or the vanquishing of notable foes.</p><p>When
        using Milestone based progression it is left to the Gamemaster to decide
        when the characters' deeds are deserving of level
        advancement.</p><blockquote><p>You can apply the concept of Milestone
        progression while still using the rules for Encounter-based advancement
        by ignoring Encounter Level and instead awarding a number of advancement
        points that you feel are appropriate upon the completion of any
        meaningful challenge.</p></blockquote>

        <p>While character creation is technically finished once the "Complete"
        button has been pressed, there are a few details you may wish to add to
        your character:</p><h3>Starting Equipment</h3><p>Choosing starting
        equipment is an important part of beginning any adventure. We advise
        Gamemasters to work closely with their players to determine what basic
        equipment they feel is appropriate for each character by browsing the
        existing Equipment compendium (found on the compendium tab in the Items
        folder). Dragging items from this compendium onto your newly created
        Actor Sheet will assign the item to that Actor's Inventory.</p><p>A
        level 1 character should not have more than <strong>35pp
        (350gp)</strong> worth of items and equipment.</p><p>A level 1 character
        should not start with any enchanted items.</p><p>It is important that
        when adding character equipment you mark anything that the character is
        wearing as equipped by clicking on the Equip button on the right hand
        side of the sheet next to the edit and delete buttons.</p><section
        class="foundryvtt"><p>While Crucible includes a number of example Items,
        Gamemasters can create and use their own custom Items either through the
        sidebar tab (for items that will be used by many characters) or by
        clicking the + icon on the bottom right corner of any Actor's inventory
        tab for more unique, character-specific
        items.</p></section><h3>Appearance and Details</h3><p>With character
        creation finished, it's a good idea to choose a picture to represent
        your character by clicking on the icon of the hooded figure on the upper
        left corner of the actor sheet. In addition, on the Biography tab, you
        can fill in some important details such as Pronouns, Age, Height,
        Weight, and provide a physical description to accompany your
        hero.</p><h3>Biographies</h3><p>As a final piece of character creation,
        you might wish to provide a Public Biography that other players in your
        game will be able to see, containing some facts about your hero's
        reputation and history. Any details in the Private Biography section
        will only be shown to you and your gamemaster, making it a useful place
        to write your hero's complete backstory.</p>
