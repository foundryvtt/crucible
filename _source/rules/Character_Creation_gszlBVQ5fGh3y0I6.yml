        <p>The first step in character creation is selecting an
        @UUID[Compendium.crucible.rules.JournalEntry.characterMechani.JournalEntryPage.ancestry00000000],
        which classifies the biology and physiology of a character in Crucible,
        and grants the newly created hero specific starting traits.</p><p>You
        can change your character's Ancestry at any point during the character
        creation, but be aware that doing so may impact your currently assigned
        Ability Scores if you have already chosen them and that may require
        re-selecting them before completing your character creation.</p><section
        class="foundryvtt"><p>While Crucible provides a number of example
        ancestries, it also allows use of custom ancestries by providing a way
        for GMs to configure their own compendium packs to use as a source
        during character creation. To add your compendium as a source, go to
        <strong>Configure Settings ➤ Crucible ➤ Configure Compendium
        Sources</strong>.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Ancestry
        Features</h2><p>Each Ancestry includes:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>Primary
        Ability</strong> Score (which begins at 3)</p></li><li><p>A
        <strong>Secondary Ability</strong> Score (which begins at
        2)</p></li><li><p>Optionally, a <strong>Damage Resistance</strong> (+3)
        and a <strong>Damage Vulnerability</strong> (-3).</p></li><li><p>A
        <strong>Size</strong> value in grid spaces (typically
        4)</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Stride</strong> value in grid spaces that
        determines the starting movement speed (typically 10)</p></li><li><p>An
        <strong>Ancestral Talent </strong>which grants a specific special
        ability or knowledge to a character of that
        ancestry.</p></li></ul><section class="construction"><p>Currently, the
        built-in Ancestries which are provided with the Crucible system do not
        have unique starting talents. Unique talents for these built-in

        Scores. To spend Ability Points click the up or down arrows to the right
        of the desired Ability.</p><p>You may only increase a single Ability
        Score a maximum of 3 times during character creation. A counter at the
        top of the Ability Scores section displays how many points you have
        remaining to spend.</p><p>Once you have completed character creation and
        advanced your character to <strong>Level 1</strong> the starting Ability
        Scores which you purchased can no longer be changed, but these ability
        scores may still be increased over time as you continue to level up.</p>

        <p>This chapter of the rules guides Gamemasters and Players through the
        process of creating their characters and preparing for play.</p><h2
        class="divider">Creating a Party</h2><p>Begin setting up a game in
        Crucible by creating a <strong>Party</strong> which the player
        characters can all belong to by creating an Actor with the
        <strong>Group</strong> type. As players create their heroes, add them to
        the Party by dragging-and-dropping them onto the Party
        sheet.</p><section class="foundryvtt"><p>Once you have created a Party,
        you should also configure this group as the "Primary Adventuring Party"
        under <strong>Game Settings ➤ Crucible ➤ Primary Adventuring
        Party</strong>. Taking this step allows a large number of mechanics to
        be automated which depend on knowing which group is the party of active
        Heroes.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Creating
        Heroes</h2><p><strong>Heroes</strong> are the characters in Crucible
        which are controlled and portrayed by players, also known as "player
        characters". All Heroes, even those at Level 1, are capable adventurers.
        They are smart, charismatic, athletic, and skillful - but not yet to a
        degree that is wondrous. As characters advance in level they attain
        tiers of power where their physical, mental, and social capabilities are
        truly legendary. Character advancement in Crucible is level-based.
        Increases in level grant additional Ability, Skill, and Talent points to
        spend which increase a character's power and capabilities. The maximum
        character level in Crucible is anticipated to be
        <strong>18</strong>.</p><section class="foundryvtt"><p>Character
        creation is an easy process which begins by creating a <strong>New
        Actor</strong> of the <strong>Hero</strong> type. Creating a character
        is a guided process with a unique interface that walks you through the
        process step-by-step. You may reset the character creation process at
        any time by clicking the "restart" button located at the top right of
        the character creation screen.</p></section><p></p><h2
        class="divider">Starting Level</h2><p>If organizing a gameplay
        experience that seeks to tell the origin story of heroes, starting your
        game at Level 1 is the recommended choice. If, however, you want to jump
        into an adventure with characters who are already established champions,
        beginning at a higher level may be more suitable.</p><blockquote><p>If
        starting at a higher level than 1, we recommend each player prepare a
        set of short anecdotes which explain the skill and talent advancements
        that their character has unlocked prior to the start of the game. This
        process helps to solidify their character backstory through past events
        that explain their heroic capabilities.</p></blockquote><p>Review the
        pages in this journal entry to understand the steps of character
        creation and the choices you will make during that process.</p>

        <p>Each time you gain a character <strong>Level</strong> beyond 1 you
        can further advance your character's powers and capabilities. Each

        convenient marking of milestones through the Group Actor sheet, which
        allows the GM to add group members to the sheet by dragging them from
        the Actor sidebar. After a group has been formed, clicking the center of
        the hex for Milestones Earned raises an award prompt, allowing the GM to
        quickly add an identified milestone, amount of award, and reason for the
        milestone being awarded. When awarding a milestone through this method,
        the GM may also selectively grant the milestone only to particular group
        members.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Milestone
        Progression</h2><p>The number of milestone points required to advance in

        <p>While character creation is technically finished once the "Complete"
        button has been pressed, there are a few details you may wish to add to

        Configuration</strong> menu you can set your configure your newly
        created Hero as your <strong>Player Character</strong>, which will allow

        class="divider">Starting Equipment</h2><p>Choosing starting equipment is
        an important part of beginning any adventure. We advise Gamemasters to
        work closely with their players to determine what basic equipment they
        feel is appropriate for each character by browsing the existing
        Equipment compendium (found on the compendium tab in the Items folder).
        Dragging items from this compendium onto your newly created Actor Sheet
        will assign the item to that Actor's Inventory.</p><p>A newly created
        character begins their journey with [[/award 25gp]] which is
        automatically added to their inventory. You may spend this initial
        budget on starting equipment. As you purchase initial equipment, deduct
        the full <strong>Scaled Price</strong> of each item from your initial
        gold allowance.</p><section class="construction"><p>We anticipate that a
        guided experience to spending your starting gold budget on initial items
        may be added as a Character Creation step in the
        future!</p></section><p>It is important that when adding character
        equipment you mark anything that the character is wearing as equipped by
        clicking on the Equip button on the right hand side of the sheet next to
        the edit and delete buttons.</p><section
        class="foundryvtt"><p>Gamemasters can create and use their own custom
        Items either through the sidebar tab (for items that will be used by
        many characters) or by clicking the + icon on the bottom right corner of
        any Actor's inventory tab for more unique, character-specific
        items.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Appearance and
        Details</h2><p>With character creation finished, it's a good idea to
        choose a picture to represent your character by clicking on the icon of
        the hooded figure on the upper left corner of the actor sheet. In
        addition, on the Biography tab, you can fill in some important details
        such as <strong>Pronouns</strong>, <strong>Age</strong>,
        <strong>Height</strong>, <strong>Weight</strong>, and provide a physical
        description to accompany your hero.</p><h2
        class="divider">Biographies</h2><p>As a final piece of character
        creation, you might wish to provide a <strong>Public Biography</strong>
        that other players in your game will be able to see, containing some
        facts about your hero's reputation and history. Any details in the
        <strong>Private Biography</strong> section will only be shown to you and
        your gamemaster, making it a useful place to write your hero's complete
        backstory.</p>
