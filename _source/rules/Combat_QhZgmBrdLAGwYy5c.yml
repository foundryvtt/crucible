        <p><strong>Conditions</strong> are temporary status effects which apply
        to a character. These conditions modify what actions the character can
        take, its resource pools, or the way that certain rules are applied to
        that character. This page separates Conditions into two categories;
        Statuses which describe the character's state of being and
        Damage-Over-Time which are detrimental or ameliorating effects which
        apply at the beginning of the character's <strong>Turn</strong> in
        Combat.</p><p>The following conditions can apply to creatures when
        specific circumstances are met.</p><h2 class="divider">Health
        Statuses</h2><h4>Weakened</h4><p>A creature that is
        <strong>Weakened</strong> is vulnerable to taking deadly wounds.
        Protagonists become Weakened when they reach zero Health. Any further
        damage to Health taken while Weakened increases Wounds.</p><p>While a
        creature is Weakened, it suffers -1 to maximum Action, loses access to a
        free Movement action, and suffers an additional <strong>2
        Vulnerability</strong> to any <strong>Morale</strong> damage
        sustained.</p><h4>Dead</h4><p>When a protagonist's Wounds reach their
        maximum value, or when an adversary's Health reaches zero, that
        character is <strong>Dead</strong>. A creature which is Dead is also
        treated as <strong>Incapacitated</strong>, can no longer Rest, and
        cannot be revived except by magical means.</p><h4>Diseased</h4><p>A
        creature that is <strong>Diseased</strong> cannot recover Health or heal
        Wounds for the duration of the Diseased
        effect.</p><h4>Invulnerable</h4><p>A creature that is
        <strong>Invulnerable</strong> is temporarily immune to Health or Wounds
        damage.</p><h2 class="divider">Morale Statuses</h2><h4>Broken</h4><p>A
        creature that is <strong>Broken</strong> is vulnerable to psychological
        trauma. Protagonists become Broken when they reach zero Morale. Any
        further damage to Morale taken while Broken increases
        Madness.</p><p>While a creature is Broken it cannot expend
        <strong>Focus</strong>, actions it takes suffer from <strong>+2
        Banes</strong>, and it suffers an additional <strong>2
        Vulnerability</strong> to any <strong>Health</strong> damage
        sustained.</p><p>Creatures which are Broken cannot contribute towards
        Flanking. Non-player Adversaries which become Broken will attempt to
        flee the battle unless they lack instincts of self-preservation or
        escape seems impossible.</p><h4>Insane</h4><p>When a protagonist's
        Madness reaches its maximum value, that character is
        <strong>Insane</strong>. A character which is Insane may no longer be
        controlled by its player and is controlled by the Gamemaster. This
        condition cannot be healed or cured except by magical
        means.</p><h4>Frightened</h4><p>A creature that is
        <strong>Frightened</strong> cannot recover Morale or heal Madness for
        the duration of the Frightened effect.</p><h4>Resolute</h4><p>A creature
        which is <strong>Resolute</strong> is temporarily immune to Morale or
        Madness damage.</p><h2 class="divider">Other
        Conditions</h2><h4>Enraged</h4><p>When a creature is
        <strong>Enraged</strong>, it behaves recklessly and is less able to
        defend itself. An <strong>Enraged</strong> creature's Block and Parry
        defenses become zero and that creature cannot expend
        Focus.</p><h4>Exposed</h4><p>Some attacks can leave an enemy temporarily
        vulnerable. When a creature is <strong>Exposed</strong> attacks against
        it gain +2 Boons.</p><h4>Flanked</h4><p>When a creature is
        <strong>Engaged</strong> by multiple foes which are its own size or
        larger and those foes are located on opposite sides of its square, the
        creature is considered to be <strong>Flanked</strong>.</p><p>When
        attacking a creature that is your size or smaller that is currently
        <strong>Flanked</strong>, you gain a number of <strong>Boons</strong> to
        Attack abilities equal to the number of flanking allies (excluding
        yourself).</p><h4>Incapacitated</h4><p>When a creature is entirely
        unable to act, it is <strong>Inacapacitated</strong>. When a target is
        Incapacitated, its <strong>Dodge, Block, </strong>and<strong>
        Parry</strong> defenses become zero and it no longer benefits from
        <strong>Ability Score</strong> bonuses to <strong>Fortitude, Willpower,
        </strong>or Reflex defense. It cannot contribute to Flanking or
        otherwise aid allies.</p><h4>Prone</h4><p>A creature that has been
        knocked to the ground, or has voluntarily thrown itself to the ground is
        considered <strong>Prone</strong>. While Prone, melee attacks against
        the target benefit from +1 Boon while ranged attacks against the target
        suffer from +1 Bane. Returning to your feet from a Prone position
        requires the use of a Movement action.</p><h4>Staggered</h4><p>A
        creature that is <strong>Staggered</strong> temporarily has 1 fewer
        Action Point available than normal.</p><h4>Stunned</h4><p>A creature
        that is <strong>Stunned</strong> temporarily has 2 fewer Action Points
        available than normal.</p><h4>Paralyzed</h4><p>A creature that is
        <strong>Paralyzed</strong> is unable to perform Actions until the
        paralysis is ended. During this time the target is
        <strong>Incapacitated</strong>.</p><h4>Slowed</h4><p>A creature that is
        <strong>Slowed</strong> pays a +1 Action cost for any Action that
        involves Movement, including the free Move action each Turn which costs
        1 AP instead.</p><h4>Restrained</h4><p>A creature that is
        <strong>Restrained</strong> is unable to perform any Action which
        involves Movement.</p><h4>Disoriented</h4><p>A creature that is
        <strong>Disoriented </strong>incurs a +1 Focus cost to all Actions which
        require Focus.</p><h4>Guarded</h4><p>Some terrain or abilities may
        temporarily harden a creature's defenses. When a creature is
        <strong>Guarded </strong>attacks against it suffer +1
        Banes.</p><h4>Unaware</h4><p>A creature that is <strong>Unaware</strong>
        acts in combat at Initiative 1 and cannot perform Reactions.</p><h2
        class="divider">Damage-Over-Time</h2><p>Some types of damage deal
        additional delayed damage. The following conditions cause damage that
        occurs at the start of a character's turn.</p><h4>Bleeding</h4><p>A
        <strong>Bleeding </strong>creature suffers additional Piercing or
        Slashing damage, depending on the triggering damage type, at the start
        of its subsequent turns.</p><h4>Poisoned</h4><p>A
        <strong>Poisoned</strong> creature suffers additional Poison damage at
        the start of its subsequent turns.</p><h4>Corroding</h4><p>A
        <strong>Corroding</strong> creature suffers additional Acid damage at
        the start of its subsequent turns.</p><h4>Burning</h4><p>A
        <strong>Burning</strong> creature suffers additional Fire damage at the
        start of its subsequent turns.</p><h4>Freezing</h4><p>A
        <strong>Freezing</strong> creature suffers additional Cold damage at the
        start of its subsequent turns.</p><h4>Irradiated</h4><p>An
        <strong>Irradiated</strong> creature suffers additional Radiant damage
        at the start of its subsequent turns.</p><h4>Decaying</h4><p>A
        <strong>Decaying </strong>creature suffers additional Corruption damage
        at the start of its subsequent turns.</p>

        <p><strong>Initiative</strong> reflects your character's swiftness of
        mind and body - corresponding to how quickly you are able to act in a
        situation where time is of the essence. Your character's initiative
        during combat is determined by your Dexterity and Intellect attributes,
        any passive Initiative Bonus you may have, any situational bonus which
        allows you to react faster than usual, and an element of random
        chance.</p><h2 class="divider">Rounds and Turns</h2><p>Each combat
        encounter is divided into <strong>Rounds</strong> and
        <strong>Turns</strong>. A <strong>Round</strong> refers to a single set
        of choices made by the characters in the encounter, where each character
        gets to act in an order defined by their <strong>Initiative</strong>.
        Each round loosely represents 10 seconds of real time, where 6 rounds of
        combat occur each minute of the encounter's duration. A
        <strong>Turn</strong> represents the actions taken by the one character
        whose turn it is to act in the initiative order.</p><h2
        class="divider">Initiative Calculation</h2><p>Your initiative is
        determined by:</p><section class="formula"><p
        class="value">Initiative</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">3d8[Boons,Banes] + ((Dexterity + Intellect) /
        4)</p></section><p>A situational bonus to initiative could result from
        you getting the drop on an enemy, or benefiting from a magical spell
        which hastens your reactions, alternatively you could face a situational
        penalty to initiative if your reactions are dulled or slowed by
        alchemical or magical effects.</p><p>Each round of combat you have a
        pool of Action Points which you may elect to spend in various ways. If
        you are not immobilized or incapacitated, any unspent Action Points at
        the end of each round are defined as action reserves which each add a
        <strong>Boon</strong> to your Initiative roll for the following
        round.</p><blockquote><p>Re-rolling initiative every round introduces
        greater tactical challenge for players who cannot rely completely upon
        always acting before or after the same foes each round of combat. Being
        able to convert unspent action points into an initiative bonus in the
        subsequent round can also promote creative tactical solutions to a
        variety of combat challenges.</p></blockquote><h4>Automatic
        Initiative</h4><p>Since <strong>Initiative</strong> automatically
        updates every <strong>Round</strong> of combat, players do not roll for
        Initiative themselves. Instead this process is automated that every
        character's initiative roll is automatically performed in order to
        maintain a satisfying pace to combat encounters.</p><h4>Incapacitated
        Combatants</h4><p>Combatants who are <strong>Incapacitated</strong> or
        <strong>Dead</strong> are automatically placed at Initiative 0 and their
        turns come last in each Round.</p><h2 class="divider">Escalation and
        Morale</h2><p>As the tension of combat escalates - so too do the
        consequences on <strong>Morale</strong> for combatants. After 6 Rounds
        of Combat at the start of each subsequent round, the combatant with the
        highest <strong>Initiative</strong> result gains additional Morale equal
        to the numbered <strong>Round</strong> of combat. The combatant with the
        lowest Initiative result (excluding Incapacitated and Dead combatants)
        loses Morale equal to the numbered Round of combat.</p>

        <p>An <strong>Attack Roll</strong> is performed by making a
        <strong>Standard Check</strong> tested against a certain <strong>Defense
        Score</strong> of the target creature. Attack Rolls are made when the
        effectiveness of an ability is evaluated in opposition to an opponent.
        Attack Rolls apply to weapon attacks, spell casts, healing abilities,
        and even some skill checks which are performed in combat.</p><p>The
        player whose character is performing the Attack is always the one to
        make the roll, while the effectiveness of the defending character or
        creature is based on their defense scores. The Attack Roll uses the same
        modified dice pool as a Standard Check, expressed as:</p><section
        class="formula"><p class="value">Attack Roll</p><p
        class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">3d8[+Boons, -Banes] + Ability
        Modifier + Skill Bonus + Enchantment Bonus</p></section><p>The 3d8 dice
        pool is modified by <strong>Boons</strong> and <strong>Banes</strong>.
        The ability modifier for the attack roll is determined by the scaling
        formula of the weapon type being used. The Skill Bonus for the attack
        roll is determined by the character's training in that particular weapon
        type. The Enchantment Bonus for the roll is determined by the magical
        properties (if any) of the weapon being used.</p><h2
        class="divider">Determining Attack Outcomes</h2><p>The attack is a hit
        if the result of the Attack Roll exceeds the Defense score of the
        target. If the result of the attack roll is less than the Defense score,
        the attack is ineffective. For attacks which target Physical Defense the
        nature of the miss (Deflected, Blocked, Dodged, or Parried) is further
        determined by the component Physical Defense scores of the target
        creature.</p><h2 class="divider">Overflow and Damage</h2><p>The amount
        by which the Attack Roll exceeded the Defense score is called
        <strong>Overflow</strong>. This Overflow amount is multiplied by a
        <strong>Damage Multiplier</strong> which is usually 1, but occasionally
        higher or lower. Then any additive <strong>Damage Bonus</strong> is
        applied, and lastly any <strong>Resistance</strong> possessed by the
        target creature is subtracted from the result.</p><section
        class="formula"><p class="value">Overflow</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">Attack Roll - Defense Score</p></section><section
        class="formula"><p class="value">Damage</p><p class="equals">=</p><p
        class="equation">(Overflow × Damage Multiplier) + Damage Bonus - Target
        Resistance</p></section><p>While Damage Resistance is a powerful way for
        creatures to reduce incoming damage, such damage cannot be mitigated
        entirely. Abilities which deal direct (immediate) damage that surpass
        the target's Defense Score always deal at least 1 point of damage to
        their target Resource.</p><p>Abilities which deal indirect
        damage-over-time, however, can have the effects of that indirect damage
        reduced to zero by Resistance.</p><h2 class="divider">Critical Hits and
        Misses</h2><p>If the Attack Roll exceeds the Defense Score by an amount
        greater than the attacker's Critical Hit Threshold (6 in most cases) it
        becomes a <strong>Critical Hit</strong>. Similarly if the Attack Roll is
        lower than the Defense Score by an amount greater than the attacker's
        Critical Miss Threshold (6 in most cases) it becomes a <strong>Critical
        Miss</strong>.</p><p>A Critical Hit does not directly increase the
        damage of an attack - although because of the way that Overflow
        contributes to total damage, Critical Hits always deal more damage than
        normal hits.</p><p>Critical Hits and Critical Misses present
        opportunities for other things to occur. Many talents allow your
        character to cause special effects when achieving a Critical Hit, or to
        react to an enemy if an incoming attack is a Critical Miss.</p><section
        class="gameplay"><h4>Critical Hit Effects</h4><p>Zenith the Monk has
        both the <strong>Concussive Blows</strong> and <strong>Battle
        Focus</strong> talents. Zenith rolls a <strong>29</strong> on a Strike
        attack against a terrible Swamp Troll with a <strong>19 Physical
        Defense</strong>. This attack results in a <strong>Critical Hit</strong>
        and as a result the Swamp Troll is <strong>Staggered</strong> because of
        the Concussive Blows talent and Zenith recovers <strong>+1
        Focus</strong> because of the Battle Focus talent.</p></section>

        <p><strong>Movement</strong> is one of the most important actions that
        characters in Crucible will perform in combat. </p><p>Movement and
        positioning in Crucible uses a fine-grained 1 foot grid which provides
        excellent features like tactically significant movement and positioning,
        meaningful differences in creature sizes and weapon ranges, and
        intuitive areas of effect.</p><section class="foundryvtt"><p>Distances
        in the Crucible system are defined in feet. The grid size of Scenes in
        Foundry Virtual Tabletop will be automatically adjusted to have a
        subgrid with distance units of <strong>1
        foot</strong>.</p><p>Measurement distance is computed using the
        <strong>Exact √2</strong> diagonal measurement
        mode.</p></section><p>Many combat actions a character can perform
        involve the <strong>Movement</strong> tag. Such actions allow you to
        move a certain number of feet up to our equal to your character's
        <strong>Stride</strong> attribute. The distance allowed by a
        <strong>Movement </strong>action cannot be broken up or interrupted.
        There is no leftover movement saved across actions if you move less than
        your Stride.</p><p>There are no facing mechanics in Crucible, meaning
        that it does not matter which direction your Token is facing on the map,
        your character is able to perceive and act in a full 360 degree radius
        unless otherwise limited by some special effect or condition.</p><h2
        class="divider">Free Movement</h2><p>Each creature has the opportunity
        to perform one free <strong>Movement</strong> action per round of
        Combat. This means that the first Action performed each round which
        involves the Movement tag is discounted at -1 Action cost. This will
        typically make the action free to perform, but in some cases may simply
        reduce its overall cost.</p><p>Free Movement is not available to
        creatures wearing <strong>Heavy </strong>armor or those who are
        <strong>Prone</strong>. Additionally, the <strong>Slowed</strong>
        condition increases the cost of Movement actions, however the first such
        movement per round is still discounted.</p><h2
        class="divider">Terrain</h2><section class="construction"><p>Crucible
        will eventually support declaring certain grid spaces as difficult
        terrain which slow movement while traversing them. Movement costs are
        doubled within difficult terrain. Until automation for this feature is
        added, difficult terrain can be applied manually to movement costs
        however the current Alpha Playtest ignores the presence of difficult
        terrain.</p></section><h2 class="divider">Cover</h2><p>Certain terrain
        or obstacles can be counted as Cover - providing additional protection
        from incoming Spell or Weapon attacks. When a direct single-target
        attack passes through such an obstacle, the target of the attack is in
        Cover. Cover is classified according to the following
        types:</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Cover Type</p></th><th><p>Banes to
        Attacks</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Complete
        Cover</p></td><td><p>Direct attacks not
        possible</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hard Cover</p></td><td><p>+4
        Banes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Partial Hard Cover</p></td><td><p>+2
        Banes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Soft Cover</p></td><td><p>+1
        Banes</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Area of effect attacks from
        abilities with target types like Cone, Blast, or Pulse ignore the
        effects of Cover.</p><section class="construction"><p>In the future,
        definition of cover and automation of banes occurring from cover may be
        automated in the Crucible system. For the time being, Banes added due to
        Cover should be added manually when attack rolls are made.</p></section>

        <p><strong>Skill Attacks</strong> are Actions which involve use of one
        of Crucible's 16

        <p><strong>Reactions</strong> are a special type of Action which can
        only be taken on some other creature's turn in combat. Reactions have
        specific triggering conditions like <em>you dodge an melee Strike
        attack<strong> </strong></em>or <em>an ally you can see achieves a
        critical hit</em>. Reactions require spending Action or Focus points,
        and therefore cannot be performed if you do not have the required
        resources - even if the condition for the reaction is otherwise
        met.</p><p>A creature is unable to perform Reactions if they are
        <strong>Unaware</strong> or <strong>Incapacitated</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Actions</strong> encompass the activities, techniques,
        spellcraft, and attacks which are performed during a combat encounter.
        Actions modify, either positively or negatively, the resource pools of
        combatants until the encounter is resolved.</p><h2
        class="divider">Action Attributes</h2><p>Actions have the following
        properties which explain how they are used.</p><h4>Action
        Cost</h4><p>Most actions incur a cost in <strong>Action Points</strong>.
        Action Points signify and represent the time and physical exertion
        required in order to perform an action in the midst of
        combat.</p><h4>Focus Cost</h4><p>Some actions may incur a cost in
        <strong>Focus Points</strong>. Focus Points signify and represent the
        mental energy and concentration needed to perform exceptional feats of
        heroism, spellcraft, or martial prowess.</p><h4>Action Tags</h4><p>The
        functionality of Actions relies on a large set of tags which describe
        how that action behaves. Each tag can change certain aspects of the
        Action like it's prerequisites, it's target, the type of damage it
        deals, what type of dice roll is applied, whether Boons or Banes are
        added to the roll, and more. A table of Action Tags is listed at the
        bottom of this page.</p><h4>Target Type</h4><p>Each action defines a
        specific target type which describes the affected creatures or
        area-of-effect of the action. A list of possible target types is
        provided in the following section.</p><h4>Target Scope</h4><p>In
        addition to the range and area of effect of the Action described by the
        target type, each Action defines a target scope which defines which
        creature dispositions it can affect. Action scopes include "all
        creatures", "allies only", "enemies only", "self
        only".</p><h4>Activation Condition</h4><p>Certain actions may require a
        specific triggering condition to be met in order for the action to be
        eligible for use. If present, this prerequisite condition will be listed
        on the action, for example, the <strong>Defensive Roll</strong> action
        has an activation condition <em>You Dodge an incoming melee
        Strike</em>.</p><h4>Applied Effects</h4><p>Certain Actions may apply
        Active Effects to creatures they affect. Any effects applied by the
        Action will be listed on its card with a stated duration in combat Turns
        or Rounds. Some effects last until otherwise removed, having unlimited
        duration.</p><h2 class="divider">Target Types</h2><h4>Blast</h4><p>This
        action affects creatures within a circular area of effect centered on a
        grid space chosen by the character performing the action. The Blast
        action also specifies a <strong>Size</strong> which describes the radius
        of effect and a <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the maximum
        range between the originating character and the chosen center-point of
        the blast.</p><h4>Cone</h4><p>This action affects creatures within a
        narrow cone of effect. The Cone originates at the center of the grid
        space of the character performing the action. The Cone has an angle of
        60 degrees and a specified <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the
        range of the ability in grid spaces. Cone templates may be placed at 45
        degree increments only.</p><h4>Fan</h4><p>This action affects creatures
        with a broad cone of effect. The Fan originates at the center of the
        grid space of the character performing the action. The Fan has an angle
        of 120 degrees and a specified <strong>Distance</strong> which describes
        the range of the ability in grid spaces. Fan templates may be placed at
        45 degree increments only.</p><h4>None</h4><p>This action has no
        specific target. It may cause certain effects to occur but those effects
        are not specific to any particular creature. This target type is not
        typically used.</p><h4>Pulse</h4><p>This action affects creatures in a
        circular area of effect centered on the character performing the action.
        The Pulse has a specified <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the
        radius of the ability in grid spaces.</p><h4>Ray</h4><p>This action
        affects creatures in a straight line originating from the character
        performing the action. The Ray has a specified <strong>Distance</strong>
        which describes the length of its effect in grid
        spaces.</p><h4>Self</h4><p>This action only involves or affects the
        character or creature which performs it. Self-target abilities affect no
        other creatures and have no range requirement.</p><h4>Single</h4><p>This
        action targets some number of individual creatures other than the
        creature which performs it. Single target actions also specify a
        <strong>Number</strong> which describes the number of creatures targeted
        and a <strong>Distance</strong> which describes the range of the ability
        in grid spaces.</p><h4>Wall</h4><p>This action targets creatures in a
        straight line perpendicular to the character performing the action.
        Actions of the Wall type also specify a <strong>Size</strong> which
        describes the breadth of the wall and a <strong>Distance</strong> which
        describes the maximum range at which the center of the wall may be
        placed.</p><h2 class="divider">Action Tags</h2><table><thead><tr><th

        <p><strong>Engagement</strong> describes the total number of opposing
        Combatants that you can simultaneously battle against without becoming
        more vulnerable. The base Engagement for <strong>Protagonist</strong>
        characters is <strong>1</strong>, while the base Engagement for
        <strong>Adversary</strong> characters is equal to their <strong>Size -
        2</strong> with a minimum of <strong>1</strong>.</p><p>When a character
        is adjacent to multiple enemies where the number of engaged enemies
        equals or exceeds their Engagement score, that character is said to be
        <strong>Fully Engaged</strong>. Some conditions or action prerequisites
        may only occur when a creature is Fully Engaged.</p><section
        class="foundryvtt"><p>To help visualize how Engagement and Flanking
        mechanics works, there is a special toggle that can be used in
        the<strong> Tokens Layer</strong> of the <strong>Scene Controls
        </strong>UI on the left side of the screen. While enabled, the
        Engagement rectangles and flanked status of a creature will be
        visualized to help understand its current status.</p></section><h2
        class="divider">Flanking</h2><p>Flanking occurs when you and your allies
        team up to combat an opponent. When a creature is
        <strong>Engaged</strong> with a number of creatures greater than its
        <strong>Engagement</strong> score it has the <strong>Flanked</strong>
        condition. The Flanked condition has multiple stages, and each stage of
        Flanked contributes +1 Boon to attack rolls made against that
        creature.</p><section class="formula"><p class="value">Flanked
        Stage</p><p class="equals">=</p><p class="equation">Number of Engaged
        Enemies<br />- Engagement Score<br />- Engagement Bonus from Adjacent
        Allies</p></section><section class="gameplay"><p>Krag, a heavily armored
        fighter, has an <strong>Engagement</strong> score of <strong>3</strong>,
        with bonuses from his <strong>True Grit</strong> talent and from his
        Heater Shield with the <strong>Engaging</strong> property. Krag can
        engage with three opposing combatants simultaneously without them
        acquiring any Flanking bonus against him. However if Krag is surrounded
        by five Goblins, he would have the <strong>Flanked 2</strong> condition
        and each Goblin's attacks would benefit from <strong>+2 Boons (5 engaged
        enemies - 3 Engagement)</strong>.</p></section><p>While having more
        Engaged enemies increases your Flanked condition, having adjacent allies
        who are supporting you can nullify flanking. Allies contribute their own
        <strong>Engagement</strong> as a bonus to yours if you share enemies in
        common that you are both Engaged with.</p><section
        class="gameplay"><p>Krag, from our previous example, is still surrounded
        by 5 Goblins and is <strong>Flanked 2</strong>. His ally Jinora comes to
        join the fray. Jinora has an <strong>Engagement</strong> score of
        <strong>2</strong>. When Jinora moves next to Krag, and into a position
        where Jinora can engage at least 2 of the Goblins, Krag's Flanked
        condition is removed because Jinora's 2 Engagement adds to Krag's own
        Engagement score, allowing Krag to engage up to 5
        enemies.</p></section><section class="foundryvtt"><p>A status effect
        condition when a creature is <strong>Flanked</strong> is automatically
        computed and added whenever a character moves into or out of
        <strong>Engagement</strong> with other adversaries. The Flanked effect
        automatically applies the correct number of boons to attack rolls
        against the Flanked creature.</p></section><h2
        class="divider">Disengagement</h2><p>When an opponent attempts to
        disengage from you in melee combat it becomes temporarily vulnerable,
        allowing you to perform a <strong>Disengagement Strike</strong>, an
        attack with your mainhand weapon which costs 1 Focus point to perform.
        You may not make a Disengagement Attack if you are
        <strong>Unaware</strong> of the enemy moving away or if you are
        <strong>Flanked</strong> by other remaining opponents.</p><section
        class="gameplay"><p>The Goblins in our previous example have decided
        that Krag is too tough and it is advisable to disengage in search of
        more vulnerable prey. Two of the four goblins may move away from Krag
        without reciprocity, because Krag is otherwise <strong>Fully
        Engaged</strong> and therefore cannot retaliate. When the third goblin
        moves away, however, Krag spends 1 Focus point to perform a
        <strong>Disengagement Strike</strong>, burying his battle axe in the
        back of the retreating evildoer!</p></section><p>There is a safe means
        of retreating from melee combat, which is to <strong>Move
        Cautiously</strong>. This mode of movement only permits you to move a
        single space, but it denies enemies with whom you were previously
        engaged the opportunity to perform a <strong>Disengagement
        Attack</strong>.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Stealth</strong> skill, paired with concealment from

        act at Initiative 1 in Combat, last aside for Incapacitated creatures.
