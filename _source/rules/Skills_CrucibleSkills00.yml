      overview: >-
        <p>Awareness is a measure of your skill in translating sensory input
        into useful information. A character with high Awareness is able to
        notice and interpret details that others might miss, and is able to
        quickly identify and react to threats.</p>

        <p>While anyone might overhear conversations happening in a crowded
        room, those who have trained their Awareness can narrow their focus to
        more cleanly distinguish between one conversation and another.
        Similarly, a character who has trained their awareness might notice that
        the angle of an open door suggests an ambush awaits inside, someone who
        has not might only notice the open door.</p>

            Detectives work toward perfecting their ability to identify very
            fine details left behind by the careless. Characters with a
            detective specialization are uniquely capable of using information
            gathered within a location to piece together how past events may
            have transpired. They are able to identify the identity of others
            who were previously within a location by identifying evidence of
            their passage, construct a timeline of events, and identify any
            objects which might be conspicuously absent.


            Master level detectives are nearly incapable of ignoring clues
            within their surroundings. They can't help but to notice the fine
            details that others ignore. Wrinkles on the shirt of an NPC might
            indicate that they were recently in a fight, a smudge of dirt might
            indicate that someone had traveled a particular path, a small scuff
            on a particular object might indicate the identity of who recently
            handled it.

            Sentinels are trained to be aware of their surroundings at all
            times, and are able to notice even the slightest changes in their
            environment. They are very quick to note changes in their immediate
            environment, often first to notice ambushes, concealed weapons,
            hidden traps, and other threats. They are used to long hours
            standing watch, and are able to maintain a high level of alertness
            for extended periods of time.


            Master Sentinels have trained themselves to maintain a state of
            hypervigilance by following a rotating pattern of focusing their
            attention on distant and close surroundings. They make for tireless
            and attentive guards, and rarely fall prey to ambushes or traps. A
            Master Sentinel can spot the shift of body weight that precedes an
            attack, the subtle signs of tampering that indicate the presence of
            a trap, and are known for having a near extra-sensory perceptive
            ability to detect the presence of others.

            Prescients focus their awareness training on the delicate art of
            identifying the patterns in the behavior of others. Given a little
            time to observe a subject, a prescient can predict where they may be
            at any particular time of day, how the subject will react to a given
            situation, and what their likely course of action will be.


            A Master Prescient is uniquely capable of predicting the actions of
            others and the way events will unfold. With almost supernatural
            precision, they may identify the factors which contribute to an
            upcoming event, predict the movements of specific targets or groups,
            and identify the places and times to best introduce a change in
            order to affect the outcome of events.

                party may reposition themselves, moving up to three spaces in
                any direction. If an ally would fail an awareness roll, a
                Prescient may intervene on their behalf, allowing them to
                reroll- once.

            A Tracker can spot signs left behind by movement, and how recently

            Master Trackers inherently spot the signs that a trail has been

            thread left behind on a thorn, the slight depression of soil or sand

            For a Master Explorer, obstacles can actually aid movement rather

            long-distance journies, shortening the time required for travel and
            identifying the best routes to take to avoid danger. 


            Master Cartographers are uniquely capable of planning a long journey
            in such a way that it trivializes the dangers faced and effort

        Religion is the study of spirits, deities, order, chaos, and their
        influence upon the world. It covers knowledge related to spiritual
        beliefs, societal traditions and rituals, and the study of the way
        spirits of lesser and higher power interact with the world. Religion is

        The Society skill is most often used for the purposes of research, to

        factors which contribute to social structures. Society is rolled to
        establish historical or socio-political context, to identify the social
        rank of particular individuals, or to otherwise draw connections between
        a person or place and its most likely contributors.

      overview: >-
        Deception most commonly comes into play when a character is attempting
        to lie or mislead others, forge documents, or pierce the veil of lies
        others construct. Those who pursue an education in Deception are often
        politicians, diplomats, spies, thieves, or other professions for whom
        flexibility in the truth is a necessity. Practicing the art of deception
        reveals the one universal truth: everybody lies. For some, it is a
        relatively innocent practice to spare the feelings of others, but for
        someone who has trained in the art of deception, a well-crafted lie is a
        tool to shape the future.

            telltale signs that tend to give away poor liars. You can construct
            a basic forgery for most common documents, but they won't stand up

            consistent, and how to hold yourself in a way that makes you seem
            more trustworthy. Your knowledge of common body language and social
            cues makes it easier for you to spot lies crafted by others, and you

        Intimidation is used to force others to do your bidding, whether through

        of intimidation are capable of using their words and actions to inspire
        fear in others, to demonstrate dominance or press others into
        subservience. Those who train their skill in intimidation need not

            silence or withering glare can spark far more fear than any
            outwardly violent display. Sometimes, just the tone in which a

        often situations that require a character to confirm their capabilities.
        At any time GM may call for a S<strong>kill Check</strong>- a simple
        roll to test whether you have sufficient skill to perform an action or
        recall some piece of information. Each skill is associated with two

        Skill Check</h4><p>Albert, our storied naval captain from a previous
        example, is faced with a dilemma. His ship is about to be imperilled by
        a storm, and his crew is looking to him to safely navigate out of the
        harbour. As a Master Cartographer, Albert taps into his extremely strong
        knowledge of long-distance travel. This will be a Challenging (DC 25)
        roll; Albert rolls his Skill check. Unluckily, Albert's dice total turn
        up <strong>6</strong>, <strong>4</strong>, and <strong>7</strong>— a
        total of <strong>17</strong> and a far cry from the needed 25. However,
        Albert's ability score for Strength is quite high at <strong>8</strong>,
        and his Dexterity is <strong>6, </strong>so the average of the two
        abilities adds an Ability bonus of <strong>7</strong>. Albert also
        happens to have a magical set of nautical charts which grant a +2
        enchantment bonus, pushing the result of the roll to
        <strong>26</strong>.</p></section><h2>Table:
