      overview: >-
        <p>Awareness is a measure of your skill in translating sensory input
        into useful information. A character with high Awareness is able to
        notice and interpret details that others might miss, and is able to
        quickly identify and react to threats.</p>

        <p>While anyone might overhear conversations happening in a crowded
        room, those who have trained their Awareness can narrow their focus to
        more cleanly distinguish between one conversation and another.
        Similarly, a character who has trained their awareness might notice that
        the angle of an open door suggests an ambush awaits inside, someone who
        has not might only notice the open door.</p>

            You have been trained in the basics of situational awareness, and
            are able to notice important details about your environment. You
            know to check for exits when you enter a room, and how to look for

            well in advance. You know how to identify less common hiding places,
            and identify the approach of others by the sound of their footsteps.
            You have learned to use reflective surfaces to watch behind you as
            you move, and how to rely on your peripheral vision to identify

            hiding places is trivial for you, you are almost never taken by
            surprise, and even in a crowded room you are able to filter your
            senses to determine very specific details. Even slight changes in

          overview: >-
            Detectives work toward perfecting their ability to identify very
            fine details left behind by the careless. Characters with a
            detective specialization are uniquely capable of using information
            gathered within a location to piece together how past events may
            have transpired. They are able to identify the identity of others
            who were previously within a location by identifying evidence of
            their passage, construct a timeline of events, and identify any
            objects which might be conspicuously absent.


            Master level detectives are nearly incapable of ignoring clues
            within their surroundings. They can't help but to notice the fine
            details that others ignore. Wrinkles on the shirt of an NPC might
            indicate that they were recently in a fight, a smudge of dirt might
            indicate that someone had traveled a particular path, a small scuff
            on a particular object might indicate the identity of who recently
            handled it.

            Sentinels are trained to be aware of their surroundings at all
            times, and are able to notice even the slightest changes in their
            environment. They are very quick to note changes in their immediate
            environment, often first to notice ambushes, concealed weapons,
            hidden traps, and other threats. They are used to long hours
            standing watch, and are able to maintain a high level of alertness
            for extended periods of time.


            Master Sentinels have trained themselves to maintain a state of
            hypervigilance by following a rotating pattern of focusing their
            attention on distant and close surroundings. They make for tireless
            and attentive guards, and rarely fall prey to ambushes or traps. A
            Master Sentinel can spot the shift of body weight that precedes an
            attack, the subtle signs of tampering that indicate the presence of
            a trap, and are known for having a near extra-sensory perceptive
            ability to detect the presence of others.

            Prescients focus their awareness training on the delicate art of
            identifying the patterns in the behavior of others. Given a little
            time to observe a subject, a prescient can predict where they may be
            at any particular time of day, how the subject will react to a given
            situation, and what their likely course of action will be.


            A Master Prescient is uniquely capable of predicting the actions of
            others and the way events will unfold. With almost supernatural
            precision, they may identify the factors which contribute to an
            upcoming event, predict the movements of specific targets or groups,
            and identify the places and times to best introduce a change in
            order to affect the outcome of events.

            inattention in order to slip things from (or into) the pockets of
            others. Rogues gain +2 boons to stealth rolls related to bypassing
            locks, disabling traps, and may use stealth to pickpocket others. 


            For a Master Rogue the very concept of security is childish, there
            are few locks that don't yield and few pockets that can't be picked.
            A Master Rogue has trained to bypass the security of even the most

        <p>Whether the focus of the education is magical or religious in nature,

            Your education covered the fundamentals of metaphysics and magical

            magic is sufficient to identify which lesser rune a spell or ritual
            may be using, as well as the gesture used (if not the inflection).
            You can identify whether a figure is influenced more by chaos or by

      overview: >-
        The Society skill is most often used for the purposes of research or
        understanding into the nuanced aspects of a social situation. Those
        educated in the workings of Society study the factors which contribute
        to social structures. Knowledge of Society is used to establish
        historical or socio-political context, to identify the social rank of
        particular individuals, or to otherwise draw connections between a
        person or place and its most likely contributors. Those who study
        Society are often more capable of using that knowledge to gain the upper
        hand in social situations, though they are not necessarily more
        charismatic or socially adept – merely better informed.

            You have learned the fundamental building blocks of Society, the
            mores, beliefs, history and politics which directly inform the
            growth of culture. You know that history and politics contribute
            with greater prominence to the way decisions are made at the highest
            and lowest levels of society, and how tradition frequently informs
            subgroups of society to place them in opposition to one another.

            You have learned a great deal of historical and social facts, and
            can recall many of them easily. You know the lineages of most
            prominent families for several generations and know the names of the
            most influential figures of the aristocracy. You know the names and
            stories of common folk heroes, and the origins and importance of
            common traditions. Your ability to recall common socio-political and
            cultural references makes it easier for you to be accepted by a wide
            variety of social groups, and to interpret their struggles. You
            would make a good envoy.

            of your sociopolitical and historical knowledge are nearly
            boundless, allowing you to identify all of the factors which might
            contribute to a social issue.

            Historians analyze documents and records, conducting research in
            service to the greater cause of understanding how past events
            influence the present. They are trained to identify the most likely
            causes of historical events, and to draw connections between the
            past and the present. A historian is able to trace and identify the
            origins of ruins, verify authenticity of documents, relics, and use
            the breadth of their knowledge to aid others in their recall.

            Politicians dedicate their area of study to understanding the
            workings of the political machine, and the motivations of those who
            operate it. They are trained to identify the most likely causes of
            political events, and where best to apply pressure in order to
            manipulate social situations. A politician is able to identify the
            most likely motivations of a political figure, and uses that
            knowledge to apply leverage and influence for their own ends.

            Scoundrels gain their societal knowledge through personal
            experience, often without the benefit of formal education. Their
            knack for understanding the motivations of others is often a matter
            of survival, and their fit within society often drifts toward the
            underclass. They move amid the seedy underbelly of society, building
            networks of contacts and informants, and mapping the social hubs
            where the aristocracy fear to tread.

      overview: >-
        Deception most commonly comes into play when a character is attempting
        to lie or mislead others, forge documents, or pierce the veil of lies
        others construct. Those who pursue an education in Deception are often
        politicians, diplomats, spies, thieves, or other professions for whom
        flexibility in the truth is a necessity. Practicing the art of deception
        reveals the one universal truth: everybody lies. For some, it is a
        relatively innocent practice to spare the feelings of others, but for
        someone who has trained in the art of deception, a well-crafted lie is a
        tool to shape the future.

            a basic forgery for most common documents, but they won't stand up
            to any measure of close scrutiny.

            practiced liar. You know how to omit the truth and keep your lies
            consistent, and how to hold yourself in a way that makes you seem
            more trustworthy. Your knowledge of common body language and social
            cues makes it easier for you to spot lies crafted by others, and you

            capable of telling the truth in ways that make it seem like a lie.
            In most social settings you are a conductor, guiding others to hear
            what they want to hear and believe what they want to believe. The
            lies of even some of the most practiced manipulators are obvious to
            your keen observation. Your capability with forgery of documents and
            items is reasonable enough that it will stand up to scrutiny, except
            from the most practiced experts.

        Diplomacy is rolled most often to pursuade others to see things your

            black markets and back alleys.

            Counsellors focus on the art of tending to the psyche, treating
            wounds of the mind and soul rather than tending to the body.
            Counsellors believe that a wounded mind is no different than a
            wounded body, and that with adequate aid even the most twisted mind
            can be healed. Counsellors are more often found in the employ of the
            aristocracy, though they are sometimes found within medical or
            military institutions.

        The Performance skill is rolled primarily for the purposes of
        entertaining others, whether through music, dance, storytelling, or
        other forms of artistic expression. Those who study performancy learn,
        above all else, how to use their talents to inspire and entertain
        others. Performers learn verse and music, use of pigment and light,
        poetry and story, dance and even physical feats to evoke emotional
        reactions in others.

            Entertaining isn't your strong suit and you have no training in how

            scare local wildlife than to draw an audience, and your ability to
            compose artistic works or perform feats of strength is effectively

            trained in an instrument or two, and your capability with a brush or
            pen is reasonable enough that you could probably create a passable

            feats, and you've learned how to compose song, story, or art to a

            keep your body a well-tuned machine, precise for the purposes of
            feats of strength or accuracy. People marvel at the ease with which
            you perform physical feats, and a few moments of spectacle is all

      overview: >-
        Intimidation is used to force others to do your bidding, whether through
        displays of aggression or threats of violence. Those trained in the art
        of intimidation are capable of using their words and actions to inspire
        fear in others, to demonstrate dominance or press others into
        subservience. Those who train their skill in intimidation need not
        necessarily be physically imposing in terms of stature, for words and
        deeds can be equally capable of inspiring fear.

            You have been practicing the art of threatening others for some

            You have honed your approaches to intimidating others. Your threats
            no longer necessitate overt displays, and you have learned that a

            violence. You know many of the more subtle ways to force others into
            agreement or dominate them into submission. Frequently, others wait,
            making their decisions only after they have seen which path you will

            Those who train their intimidation skill to this degree learn the
            most important lesson about intimidation: that the louder and more
            insistant you are, the less others will fear you. A prolonged
            silence or withering glare can spark far more fear than any
            outwardly violent display. Sometimes, just the tone in which a
            sentence is spoken or a question is asked can be enough to reduce a
            target to capitulation.
