  description:
    public: >-
      <p>A small brass coin with a broad, grinning face and little red garnet
      eyes. The coin is stamped with a specific sequence of sigils that link it
      with a sibling coin, allowing the two holders to communicate over vast
      distances.</p><p>If you hold the coin and speak to it, the coin
      immediately connects its sibling and begins speaking loudly, relaying what
      you're saying and what is said back. The connection lasts for up to 1
      minute before the connection breaks. Each coin can be used once per long
      rest.</p><p>The coin may be used 5 times after which its magic fades,
      becoming nearly worthless.</p>
