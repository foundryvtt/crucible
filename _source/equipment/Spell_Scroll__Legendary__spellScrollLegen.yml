      are carefully inlaid the glyphs of one or more spellcraft components.

      familiarity with those components as if they have known them for
      years.</p><p>Spell scrolls come in three tiers, according to their level
      of Enchantment. More powerful scrolls may simultaneously convey a larger
      number of spellcraft components.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Minor</strong>: May

      component</p></li><li><p><strong>Major</strong>: May contain two
