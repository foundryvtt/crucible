  description:
    public: >-
      <p>A thick, clay-lined, sealed iron pot with a hole for attaching a
      hand-bellows and a small opening for inserting metal to be heated. A set
      of bellows and a small anvil. This heavy device allows a smith to ply
      their trade while on the road, though it may take a strong back to
      transport it. Suitable for crafting most common metal tools and weapons,
      but insufficient for high quality work.</p>
