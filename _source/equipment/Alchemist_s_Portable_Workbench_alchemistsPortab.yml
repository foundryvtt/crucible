  description:
    public: >-
      <p>A portable copper distilling device favoured by alchemists with no
      access to a personal workshop due to its collapsible nature. Many of its
      fittings can be unscrewed and stored inside the body of the still for
      travel. Though this item takes time to set up and take down, it can stand
      in for a more permanent laboratory for those who travel.</p>
