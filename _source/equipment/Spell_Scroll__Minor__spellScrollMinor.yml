      <p>A spell scroll is a specialized piece of vellum or parchment upon which
      are carefully inlaid the glyphs of one or more spellcraft components.

      familiarity with those components as if they have known them for
      years.</p><p>Spell scrolls come in three tiers, according to their level
      of Enchantment. More powerful scrolls may simultaneously convey a larger
      number of spellcraft components.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Minor</strong>: May
      contain a single spellcraft
      component</p></li><li><p><strong>Major</strong>: May contain two
