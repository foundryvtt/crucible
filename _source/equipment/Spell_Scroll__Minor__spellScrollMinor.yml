      <p>A spell scroll is a specialized piece of vellum or parchment upon which
      are carefully inlaid the glyphs of one or more spellcraft components.
      Activating this spell scroll temporarily imbues its reader with a deep
      familiarity with those components as if they have known them for
      years.</p><p>Spell scrolls come in three tiers, according to their level
      of Enchantment. More powerful scrolls may simultaneously convey a larger
      number of spellcraft components.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Minor</strong>: May
      contain a single spellcraft
      component</p></li><li><p><strong>Major</strong>: May contain two
      spellcraft components</p></li><li><p><strong>Legendary</strong>: May
      contain three spellcraft components</p></li></ul>
