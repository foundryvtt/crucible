        <p>You assume an illusory appearance once per rest which alters your
        appearance as well as your attire. The illusion cannot alter your
        ancestry, but can change other aspects of your anatomy including your
        apparent gender. The cloak itself does not change in appearance and
        remains visible.</p><p>The illusion persists indefinitely and can be
        dismissed at-will. Once activated, the cloak cannot produce another
        illusion in this way until 24 hours have passed.</p>
