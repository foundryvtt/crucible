        Elemental forces presided over your birth, instilling you with
        supernatural vigor. Your large frame and muscular build often lead
        others to believe you are an unthinking mass of muscle, but yours is a
        people known most for their physical resilience and the deep well of
        their knowledge. You have inherited the strength of mountains.
