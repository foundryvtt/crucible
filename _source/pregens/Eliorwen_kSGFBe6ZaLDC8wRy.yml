            <p>Your command of the Rune of Illusion allows you to fabricate
            perception in various simple ways and to manipulate shadow and light
            to create distraction or entertainment, producing one of the
            following effects:</p><ul><li><p>Modify a single aspect of your own
            physical appearance. Such alterations might include adjusting the
            sound of your voice, changing the color of your eyes, gaining
            illusory horns, or appearing slightly taller or shorter. The
            alteration persists until you Rest or enact a different alteration
            and can be verified as illusory by physical
            inspection.</p></li><li><p>Manifest a convincing recreation of a
            short sound or single scent that you can clearly recall. The
            illusion originates from your position and lasts for 10 seconds. You
            can control the volume of the sound or odorousness of the scent to
            be perceptible up to a range of 60 feet or
            shorter.</p></li><li><p>Decouple your shadow from your form,
            specifically controlling its movements separately from your own. You
            can maintain this illusion as long as you do not perform any other
            action that consumes <strong>Focus</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>Seeming
            may only affect a creature or object you can physically touch. You
            may attempt other uses similar those above, the effectiveness of
            which is decided by the Gamemaster.</p>
