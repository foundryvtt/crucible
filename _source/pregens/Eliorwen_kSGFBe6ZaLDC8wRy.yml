        in the basics of stealth, infiltration, and subterfuge. You gain the

        are no longer considered <strong>Untrained</strong> in that

        how to use light and shadow to mask your presence, to distribute your
        weight when walking in order to move more quietly, and you have learned
        a few tricks of disguise in order to blend into a crowd. You can appear
        unsuspicious when surrounded by others, hide in a darkened room, and can
        move silently enough to avoid detection by the average
        person.</span></p>
