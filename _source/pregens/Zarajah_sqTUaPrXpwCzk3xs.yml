        <p>You were born with unexpected magical influence over your creation.
        Your physical appearance shows tell-tale signs that the superstitious
        associate with planar beings- crimson flesh, ineffective wings or horns,
        reptilian eyes. Your dislike of light and preternatural resistance to
        fire does little to dissuade people from thinking you are an actual
        devil.</p>
