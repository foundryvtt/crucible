        light and shadow to mask your presence, to distribute your weight when
        walking in order to move more quietly, and you have learned a few tricks
        of disguise in order to blend into a crowd. You can appear unsuspicious
        when surrounded by others, hide in a darkened room, and can move
        silently enough to avoid detection by the average person.</p>
