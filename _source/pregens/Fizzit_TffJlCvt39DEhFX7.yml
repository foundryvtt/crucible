            <p>Your command of the Rune of Frost allows you to manipulate
            liquids and their thermal properties, producing one of the following
            effects:</p><ul><li><p>Draw up to one quarter gallon of fresh water
            from the atmosphere into a container or upon a surface you touch.
            The created water may be affected by relevant atmospheric properties
            of your current location.</p></li><li><p>Manipulate the temperature
            of up to 1 gallon of water, causing it to immediately freeze or
            thaw. The water need not be in a container; this technique can be
            used to coat a surface or join two objects together via regelation.
            Ice created in this way remains frozen for as long as the ambient
            temperature of the environment allows.</p></li><li><p>Gather up to a
            six-foot cube of nearby snow, forming it into a solidified
            sculpture, shape, or shelter.</p></li></ul><p>Condense may only
            affect a creature or object you can physically touch. You may
