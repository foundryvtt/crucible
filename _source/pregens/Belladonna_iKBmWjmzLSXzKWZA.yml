        Found amid countless conditions and far-flung places, you were born an
        ever-adaptable human. Tall or short, thin, muscular, or rotund, your
        physical appearance is nothing if not varied. Humans are most known for
        a genetic predisposition toward determination, with traditions that
        drive a stubborn will to survive.

        Few learn to survive the way you did. Yours was a harsh education in
        distrust. You learned to watch others for the telltale signs of danger
        or disloyalty, to avoid the attention of others, scavenging for scraps
        of food on the streets of some urban sprawl.
