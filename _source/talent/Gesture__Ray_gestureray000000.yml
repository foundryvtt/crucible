  description: >-
    <p>Focus the power of a Rune into a single point, expelling its energy into
    a ranged beam which rapidly travels a short distance to a targeted area. If
    used with Life this might restore the HP of a distant ally steadily over
    time, while Frost might emit a beam that freezes a target in place.</p>

    <p>The Ray gesture scales using <strong>Wisdom</strong> and targets a line
    emanating from the caster at distance 6, dealing 6 base damage on a
    successful attack.</p>
