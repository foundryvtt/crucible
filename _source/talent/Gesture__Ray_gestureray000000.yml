  description: >-
    <p>Focus the power of a Rune into a single point, expelling its energy into
    a ranged beam which rapidly travels a short distance to a targeted area. If
    used with Life this might restore the HP of a distant ally steadily over
    time, while Frost might emit a beam that freezes a target in
    place.</p><p>The Ray gesture scales using <strong>Wisdom</strong> and
    targets a 30 foot line emanating from the caster, dealing 6 base damage on a
    successful attack.</p>
