    <p>You concentrate the arcane power of a Rune to create a maintained field
    of energy that washes over allies and enemies near to you.</p><p>The Aura
    gesture scales with <strong>Presence</strong> and produces an emanation with
    20 feet radius centered on the spellcaster. The center of this Aura moves
    with the spellcaster.</p><p>Depending on the Rune used, the Aura deals
    damage or provides healing to any creature which begins its turn inside the
    Aura. This gesture requires <strong>2 Hands</strong> to cast, has a base
    cost of <strong>5 Action</strong> and <strong>1 Focus</strong>, and must be
    <strong>Maintained</strong> costing an additional <strong>1 Focus</strong>
    every subsequent round.</p><h3 class="divider">Playtest Notes</h3><p>This
    talent is currently placed at a <strong>Tier 4</strong> node. It will
    eventually only be attainable at a higher level (probably Level 6 required).
    It is currently available "early" for testing.</p><p>Emanation templates
    which are linked to the Token and move when the Token moves are a feature
    coming in Foundry VTT version 14. Automation of the Aura gesture will occur
    once Crucible depends on Foundry VTT version 14.</p>
