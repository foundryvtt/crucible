    You inspire courage within your allies by extolling the heroic deeds of a
    companion. You may react by composing a verse, making a quip, or shouting a
    battle cry when an ally you can see <strong>Incapacitates</strong> or
    achieves a <strong>Critical Hit</strong> against an enemy creature. The
    celebration of these heroic deeds restores the Morale of your allies within
