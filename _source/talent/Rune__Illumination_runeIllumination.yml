        <p>Your command of the Rune of Illumination allows you to create light
        and exert basic control over its radiance, producing one of the
        following effects:</p><ul><li><p>Create a ball of light called a
        "tosslight" which sheds bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light
        in a 40 foot radius. The light can hover near your body, be affixed to
        an item or surface, or be thrown up to a distance of 30 feet. You may
        dismiss your tosslight at any time and may only have a single tosslight
        at a time, casting this spell again causes your previous tosslight to
        disappear.</p></li><li><p>Inscribe up to 200 words of invisible text
        into paper like a scroll, page, or book. The text is written from light
        itself and hidden from non-magical detection. It can be made visible by
        yourself or another through use of this spell combined with a spoken
        passphrase that you define at the time of
        inscription.</p></li><li><p>Touch a physical object that produces dim
        light, causing it to become bright light for as long as you maintain
        physical contact. Only one light source may be intensified in this way
        at a given time.</p></li></ul><p>Reveal may only affect a creature or
        object you can physically touch. You may attempt other uses similar
        those above, the effectiveness of which is decided by the
        Gamemaster.</p>
