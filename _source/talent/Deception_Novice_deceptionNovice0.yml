    <p><span style="font-family:Vollkorn, serif">You are a liar and manipulator,
    and deception is a skill you've practiced. You gain the
    <strong>Novice</strong> rank in the <strong>Deception </strong>skill and are
    no longer considered <strong>Untrained</strong> in that
    skill.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Vollkorn, serif">You know how
    to construct basic lies and cons, and the telltale signs that tend to give
    away poor liars. You can construct a basic forgery for most common
    documents, but they won't stand up to any measure of close
    scrutiny.</span></p>
