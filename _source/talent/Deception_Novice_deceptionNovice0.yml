  description: >-
    <p>You are a liar and manipulator, and deception is a skill you've
    practiced. You gain the <strong>Novice</strong> rank in the
    <strong>Deception </strong>skill and are no longer considered
    <strong>Untrained</strong> in that skill.</p><p>You know how to construct
    basic lies and cons, and the telltale signs that tend to give away poor
    liars. You can construct a basic forgery for most common documents, but they
    won't stand up to any measure of close scrutiny.</p>
