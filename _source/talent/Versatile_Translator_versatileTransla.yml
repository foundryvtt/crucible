  description: >-
    <p>You have a scholarly background in linguistics or an intuitive knack for
    languages. Your capabilities enable you to decipher the basic meaning of
    text written in a variety of languages.</p><p>You can translate text of a
    language you do not know that is written using a common set of glyphs or
    characters to a language that you do know. Creating such a translation
    requires spending one minute per word to transcribe the text into a language
    which you understand.</p><p>Your translations are rudimentary and often lack
    nuance, but they do contain all essential points of the text.</p>
