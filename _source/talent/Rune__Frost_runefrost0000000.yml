        <p>Your command of the Rune of Frost allows you to manipulate liquids
        and their thermal properties, including:</p><ul><li><p>You draw up to
        one liter of fresh water from the atmosphere into a container or upon a
        surface you touch. The created water may be affected by relevant
        atmospheric properties of your current location.</p></li><li><p>You
        manipulate the temperature of up to 1 gallon of water, causing it to
        immediately freeze or thaw. The water need not be in a container; this
        technique can be used to coat a surface or join two objects together via
        regelation. Ice created in this way remains frozen for as long as the
        ambient temperature of the environment allows.</p></li><li><p>You gather
        up to six cubic feet of nearby snow, forming it into a solidified
        sculpture, shape, or shelter.</p></li></ul><p>Condense may only affect a
        creature or object you can physically touch. You may attempt other uses
        similar those above, the effectiveness of which is decided by the
        Gamemaster.</p>
