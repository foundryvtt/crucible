    <p>You immediately react to a spell being cast and compose a rune and
    gesture designed to unravel and negate the spellcraft of an enemy
    mage.</p><h2 class="divider">Playtest Notes</h2><p>This action can now be
    used in playtesting, but it is not yet <em>fully automated</em>. The
    Counterspell can be performed, but it is up to the Gamemaster to manually
    reverse a previously applied spell and to manually deduct its
    <strong>Action</strong> and <strong>Focus</strong> cost. These steps of the
    overall Counterspell workflow <em>will be automated</em> in a subsequent
    update such that a confirmed Counterspell will also confirm the spell that
    was countered, but with its effects removed.</p>

        <p>You form arcane energy into a countervailing spellcraft, targeting a
        spellcaster you can see within 30 feet.</p><p>Designate a
        <strong>Rune</strong> and <strong>Gesture</strong> which you know to
        attempt to counter the spell. Choosing a Rune which is opposed to one
        used in the spell grants <strong>+2 Boons</strong> to your attempt.
        Selecting the identical Gesture as the one being cast also adds
        <strong>+2 Boons</strong> to your attempt.</p><p>Perform a harmless
        Spell Attack against your target's <strong>Willpower</strong> defense.
        If your roll exceeds their defense, the spell is countered and its magic
        is nullified, producing no effects.</p>
