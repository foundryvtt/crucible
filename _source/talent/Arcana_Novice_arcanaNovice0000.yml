  description: >-
    <p><span style="font-family:Vollkorn, serif">Your education covered the
    fundamentals of metaphysics and magical theory, the relationship between the
    runes, the opposing nature of order and chaos, and a cursory introduction to
    spiritual beings including the most commonly known deified and demonized
    figures of worship. You gain the <strong>Novice</strong> rank in the
    <strong>Arcana </strong>skill and are no longer considered
    <strong>Untrained</strong> in that skill.</span></p><p><span
    style="font-family:Vollkorn, serif">Your rudimentary understanding of the
    principle grammar of magic is sufficient to identify which lesser rune a
    spell or ritual may be using, as well as the gesture used (if not the
    inflection). You can identify whether a figure is influenced more by chaos
    or by order, and can spot the signs of common spirits (both lesser and
    greater). You know enough about religious customs to communicate with those
    who worship a particular spirit or deity without embarrassing
    yourself.</span></p>
