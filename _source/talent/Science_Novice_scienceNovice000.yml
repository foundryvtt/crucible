    <p>You've learned to study the world around you through structured
    observation, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other disciplines. You
    gain the <strong>Novice</strong> rank in the <strong>Science </strong>skill
    and are no longer considered <strong>Untrained</strong> in that
    skill.</p><p>You are familiar with the basic principles of mathematics,
    physics, chemistry, or other scientific studies. You know how to construct
    and use simple machines for the purposes of making physical tasks easier.
    You know some of the more commonly understood scientific theories, and given
    suitable time to study more complex machines you might be able to at least
    operate them.</p>
