        <p>Your command of the Rune of Oblivion allows you to unravel tiny holes
        in the fabric of existence, producing one of the following
        effects:</p><ul><li><p>Disintegrate a non-magical object you hold
        smaller than a 6-inch cube, sundering it to a fine particulate dust of
        its component elements.</p></li><li><p>Anesthetize the ability to feel
        emotion from yourself or a willing target that you touch, causing it to
        enter a placid, stoic, or dispassionate state. This effect can be
        maintained as long as you make no further
        <strong>Action</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Subdue the potency of a light
        source, causing its visible radius to be reduced by half for as long as
        you maintain physical contact with it. Only one light source may be
        dampened in this way at a given time.</p></li></ul><p>Erase may only
        affect a creature or object you can physically touch. You may attempt
        other uses similar those above, the effectiveness of which is decided by
        the Gamemaster.</p>
