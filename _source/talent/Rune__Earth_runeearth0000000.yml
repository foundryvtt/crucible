        <p>Your command of the Rune of Earth allows you to manipulate raw forces
        of rock, mineral, and soil in basic ways including:</p><ul><li><p>You
        quickly shape up to one cubic foot of available material into a simple
        geometric form like a cuboid, ellipsoid, or
        polyhedron.</p></li><li><p>You precisely copy the physical shape of a
        held object that is smaller than 3 cubic inches, reproducing it from
        available clay, stone, or metal. The replica retains no useful
        properties except for its physical form.</p></li><li><p>You separate and
        collect earthen particles from the surface of an object, creature, or
        liquid that you touch, rendering the subject completely cleaned or
        purified in moments.</p></li></ul><p>Mould may only effect a creature or
        object you can physically touch. You may attempt other uses similar
        those above, the effectiveness of which is decided by the
        Gamemaster.</p>
