      description: >-
        <p>Your command of the Rune of Control allows you to affect the decision
        making of others in basic ways, producing one of the following
        effects:</p><ul><li><p>Moderately intensify or dampen the primary
        emotion being felt by a creature you touch. If the creature is
        intelligent enough to be aware of the laws governing spellcraft, they
        are aware of your actions.</p></li><li><p>Understand the abstract
        motivations of another living creature which allows you to touch it. You
        are able to intuit their immediate goals expressed in the form of a
        single verb.</p></li><li><p>Intensely focus on your current objective
        and the means of achieving it. You receive a brief hint or reminder from
        the Gamemaster about that objective containing only information which
        you have previously learned.</p></li></ul><p>Motivate may only affect a
        creature or object which you can physically touch. You may attempt other
        uses similar those above, the effectiveness of which is decided by the
        Gamemaster.</p>
