        <p>Your command of the Rune of Control allows you to affect the decision
        making of others in basic ways including:</p><ul><li><p>Moderately
        intensify or dampen the primary emotion being felt by a creature you
        touch. If the creature is intelligent enough to be aware of the laws
        governing spellcraft, they are aware of your
        actions.</p></li><li><p>Understand the abstract motivations of another
        living creature which allows you to touch it. You are able to intuit
        their immediate goals expressed in the form of a single
        verb.</p></li><li><p>Intensely focus on your current objective and the
        means of achieving it. You receive a brief hint or reminder from the
        Gamemaster about that objective containing only information which you
        have previously learned.</p></li></ul><p>Uses of Motivate may only
        effect yourself or another creature which you can physically touch. You
        may attempt other uses similar those above, the effectiveness of which
        is decided by the Gamemaster.</p>
