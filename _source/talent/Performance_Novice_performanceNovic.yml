  description: >-
    <p>You have learned the basic practices of art and entertainment. You gain
    the <strong>Novice</strong> rank in the <strong>Performance </strong>skill
    and are no longer considered <strong>Untrained</strong> in that
    skill.</p><p>You know a few common dances, have a collection of well-known
    tales, and you could probably sing or play a few popular songs. You may be
    trained in an instrument or two, and your capability with a brush or pen is
    reasonable enough that you could probably create a passable work of art.</p>
