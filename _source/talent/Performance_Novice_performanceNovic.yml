    <p><span style="font-family:Vollkorn, serif">You have learned the basic
    practices of art and entertainment. You gain the <strong>Novice</strong>
    rank in the <strong>Performance </strong>skill and are no longer considered
    <strong>Untrained</strong> in that skill.</span></p><p><span
    style="font-family:Vollkorn, serif">You know a few common dances, have a
    collection of well-known tales, and you could probably sing or play a few
    popular songs. You may be trained in an instrument or two, and your
    capability with a brush or pen is reasonable enough that you could probably
    create a passable work of art.</span></p>
