        <p>Your command of the Rune of Lightning allows you to conduct the flow
        of both air and electricity, manipulating charge and aerodynamics to
        produce one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>Instill an
        electromagnetic charge into a metallic object that you touch no larger
        than a one-foot cube, causing it to strongly adhere to other metals.
        Only one object can be charged in this way at a given time, casting this
        spell on a different object causes the prior object to lose its magnetic
        effect.</p></li><li><p>Gather a squall of wind at your current location
        in a six-foot radius which blows either as a gust in a single controlled
        direction or as a cyclone with centripetal force in all directions.
        Airborne effects in the immediate area are dispersed and unsecured
        objects with weight less than 1 are flung in the direction of the
        gust.</p></li><li><p>Produce the concussive sound of a thunderclap at a
        location you can see within 15 feet of your current
        position.</p></li></ul><p>Energize may only affect a creature or object
        you can physically touch. You may attempt other uses similar those
        above, the effectiveness of which is decided by the Gamemaster.</p>
