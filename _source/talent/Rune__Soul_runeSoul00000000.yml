        <p>Your command of the Rune of Soul allows you to facilitate basic forms
        of spiritual influence including:</p><ul><li><p>Enable yourself or
        another willing person to revisit a core memory of a moment from their
        past up to one minute in duration as if it happened
        recently.</p></li><li><p>Identify a negative spiritual condition that is
        affecting a person such as @Condition[broken], @Condition[frightened],
        @Condition[confused], or @Condition[insane].</p></li><li><p>Create a
        momentary spiritual connection with another willing creature that allows
        them to recognize an idea which can be expressed as a single
        word.</p></li></ul><p>Uses of Evoke may only effect yourself or another
        creature which you can physically touch. You may attempt other uses
        similar those above, the effectiveness of which is decided by the
        Gamemaster.</p>
