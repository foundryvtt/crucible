    boundaries.</p><p>The Step gesture scales with <strong>Dexterity</strong>
    and allows you to move up to 20 feet in a straight line with width equal to
    your <strong>Size</strong>. It deals <strong>2 Base Damage</strong> to
    targets along that line which fail to Resist the spell. This gesture does
    not require any free hands to cast and has a base cost of <strong>3
    Action</strong> and <strong>1 Focus</strong>.</p><h3
