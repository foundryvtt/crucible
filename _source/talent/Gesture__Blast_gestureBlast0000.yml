    <p>You hurl the arcane power of a Rune into an intense explosion of energy
    at a nearby point you can see.</p><p>The Blast gesture scales with
    <strong>Intellect</strong> and produces a blast with 6 feet radius centered
    on a point within 60 feet of the spellcaster. The blast deals <strong>8 Base
    Damage</strong> to targets which fail to Resist the spell. This gesture
    requires <strong>2 Hands</strong> to cast and has a base cost of <strong>5
    Action</strong> and <strong>2 Focus</strong>.</p><h3
    class="divider">Playtest Notes</h3><p>This talent is currently placed at a
    <strong>Tier 4</strong> node. It will eventually only be attainable at a
    higher level (probably Level 6 required). It is currently available "early"
    for testing.</p>
