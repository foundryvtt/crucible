  description: >-
    <p>Focus the essence of a rune into a sweeping or splintered arc to strike
    multiple targets in close proximity. If used with Earth, this might hurl a
    spray of stone in an arc, while using it with Kinesis might carve a slice
    across multiple foes.</p>

    <p>The Fan gesture scales using <strong>Intellect</strong> and targets a 120
    degree cone with distance 1, dealing 6 base damage on a successful
    attack.</p>
