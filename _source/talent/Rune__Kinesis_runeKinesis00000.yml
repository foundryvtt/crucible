        <p>Your command of the Rune of Kinesis allows you to exert local control
        over gravitational forces to perform basic telekinetic manipulations,
        producing one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>Pull an unsecured
        object within 15 feet and with weight no greater than 1 towards you and
        catch it. An object that is equipped or possessed by a creature is never
        treated as unsecured unless that creature is willing to release
        it.</p></li><li><p>Flick an object that you hold with weight no greater
        than 1 towards a target up to 30 feet away. The object flies unerringly
        in a straight line towards that target at a moderate speed. Any creature
        along the object's path can react to catch it as long as they have a
        free hand with which to do so.</p></li><li><p>Suspend in midair an
        object or willing creature that you touch with weight less than or equal
        to 10 times your <strong>Presence</strong>, altering its position up to
        20 feet in any direction from its original location. You can maintain
        this suspension indefinitely as long as you take no further Action and
        are not @Condition[incapacitated].</p></li></ul><p>Propel may only
        affect a creature or object you can physically touch unless otherwise
        specified. You may attempt other uses similar those above, the
        effectiveness of which is decided by the Gamemaster.</p>
