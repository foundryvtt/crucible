    <p>Expel the arcane power of a Rune in a radius that travels outward with
    you at its center.</p><p>The Pulse gesture scales using
    <strong>Presence</strong> and produces an emanation with 10 foot radius,
    dealing <strong>8 Base Damage</strong> to targets which fail to Resist the
    spell. The gesture requires <strong>2 Hands</strong> to cast and has a base
    cost of <strong>5 Action</strong> and <strong>2 Focus</strong>.</p><h3
    class="divider">Playtest Notes</h3><p>This talent is currently placed at a
    <strong>Tier 4</strong> node. It will eventually only be attainable at a
    higher level (probably Level 6 required). It is currently available "early"
    for testing.</p>
