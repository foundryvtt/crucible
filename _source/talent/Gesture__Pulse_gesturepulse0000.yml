  description: >-
    <p>Emit a burst of Runic power in a circular wave that travels outward, with
    you at its center. A Pulse of Spirit might be used to bolster Morale for
    your allies, while a Death pulse might be used to deal Corruption damage to
    a group of enemies gathered around you.</p>

    <p>The Pulse gesture scales using <strong>Presence</strong> and targets a
    360 degree radius with distance 1, dealing 6 base damage on a successful
    attack.</p>
