        <p>Your command of the Rune of Illusion allows you to fabricate
        perception in various simple ways and to manipulate shadow and light to
        create distraction or entertainment, producing one of the following
        effects:</p><ul><li><p>Modify a single aspect of your own physical
        appearance. Such alterations might include adjusting the sound of your
        voice, changing the color of your eyes, gaining illusory horns, or
        appearing slightly taller or shorter. The alteration persists until you
        Rest or enact a different alteration and can be verified as illusory by
        physical inspection.</p></li><li><p>Manifest a convincing recreation of
        a short sound or single scent that you can clearly recall. The illusion
        originates from your position and lasts for 10 seconds. You can control
        the volume of the sound or odorousness of the scent to be perceptible up
        to a range of 60 feet or shorter.</p></li><li><p>Decouple your shadow
        from your form, specifically controlling its movements separately from
        your own. You can maintain this illusion as long as you do not perform
        any other action that consumes
        <strong>Focus</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>Seeming may only affect a
        creature or object you can physically touch. You may attempt other uses
        similar those above, the effectiveness of which is decided by the
        Gamemaster.</p>
