  description: >-
    <p>You coalesce arcane power into a superior form, manifesting a
    <strong>Visitor</strong> which appears within 30 feet and joins Combat at
    <strong>Initiative</strong> 1. Your Visitor is a Minion equal to your own
    Level.</p><p>The Conjure gesture scales with <strong>Wisdom</strong> and the
    Visitor survives for <strong>12 Rounds</strong>. You may only have one
    active Visitor. Casting another spell using the Conjure gesture replaces
    your previous Visitor. This gesture requires <strong>2 Hands</strong> to
    cast and has a base cost of <strong>5 Action</strong> and <strong>2
    Focus</strong>.</p><h3 class="divider">Playtest Notes</h3><p>This talent is
    currently placed at a <strong>Tier 4</strong> node. It will eventually only
    be attainable at a higher level (probably Level 6 required). It is currently
    available "early" for testing.</p><p>Not all Runes have a Visitor actor
    defined yet. Runes that do not yet have a defined Conjuration will — for now
    — manifest a <strong>Flame Visitor</strong>.</p>
