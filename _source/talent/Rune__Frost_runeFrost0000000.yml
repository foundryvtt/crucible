        <p>Your command of the Rune of Frost allows you to manipulate liquids
        and their thermal properties, producing one of the following
        effects:</p><ul><li><p>Draw up to one quarter gallon of fresh water from
        the atmosphere into a container or upon a surface you touch. The created
        water may be affected by relevant atmospheric properties of your current
        location.</p></li><li><p>Manipulate the temperature of up to 1 gallon of
        water, causing it to immediately freeze or thaw. The water need not be
        in a container; this technique can be used to coat a surface or join two
        objects together via regelation. Ice created in this way remains frozen
        for as long as the ambient temperature of the environment
        allows.</p></li><li><p>Gather up to a six-foot cube of nearby snow,
        forming it into a solidified sculpture, shape, or
        shelter.</p></li></ul><p>Condense may only affect a creature or object
        you can physically touch. You may attempt other uses similar those
        above, the effectiveness of which is decided by the Gamemaster.</p>
