    <p>You channel the arcane power of a Rune into a rushing wave of energy that
    surges forward from your current position.</p><p>The Surge gesture scales
    with <strong>Wisdom</strong> and produces a line that is 10 feet wide and 15
    feet long originating from the spellcaster, dealing <strong>8 Base
    Damage</strong> to targets which fail to Resist the spell. The gesture
    requires <strong>2 Hands</strong> to cast and has a base cost of <strong>5
    Action</strong> and <strong>2 Focus</strong>.</p><h3
    class="divider">Playtest Notes</h3><p>This talent is currently placed at a
    <strong>Tier 4</strong> node. It will eventually only be attainable at a
    higher level (probably Level 6 required). It is currently available "early"
    for testing.</p>
