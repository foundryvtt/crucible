        <p>Your command of the Rune of Death allows for basic communion with the
        dead and for rudimentary manipulation of unholy forces, producing one of
        the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>Spread decay over an object no
        larger than a 1-foot cube, causing plants to wither, metallic objects to
        rust, wood to become rotten, food to grow foul, or a corpse to rapidly
        decompose. Magical objects are typically
        unaffected.</p></li><li><p>Cause a corpse which has been dead for less
        than seven days or otherwise preserved to perform a lifeless reenactment
        of its final moments. Its movements imitate those that occurred during
        the creature's final 30 seconds of life. You have no control over the
        creature nor can it communicate in any other way.</p></li><li><p>Hasten
        the death of a willing creature that is currently dying, causing it to
        pass swiftly and peacefully.</p></li></ul><p>Ennervate may only affect a
        creature or object you can physically touch. You may attempt other uses
        similar those above, the effectiveness of which is decided by the
        Gamemaster.</p>
