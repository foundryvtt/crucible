        <p>Your command of the Rune of Death allows for basic communion with the
        dead and for rudimentary manipulation of unholy
        forces:</p><ul><li><p>You spread decay over an object no larger than 1
        cubic foot, causing plants to wither, metallic objects to rust, wood to
        become rotten, food to grow foul, or a corpse to rapidly decompose.
        Magical objects are typically unaffected.</p></li><li><p>You cause a
        corpse which has been dead for less than seven days or otherwise
        preserved to perform a lifeless reenactment of its final moments. Its
        movements imitate those that occurred during the creature's final 30
        seconds of life. You have no control over the creature nor can it
        communicate in any other way.</p></li><li><p>You can hasten the death of
        a willing creature that is currently dying, causing it to pass swiftly
        and peacefully.</p></li></ul><p>Ennervate may only effect a creature or
        object you can physically touch. You may attempt other uses similar
        those above, the effectiveness of which is decided by the
        Gamemaster.</p>
