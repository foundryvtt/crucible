    <p>Your skill with archery can shape your spellcraft, partially substituting
    for the somatic gestures of traditional spellcasting. With a ranged weapon
    equipped you ignore the free-hand requirement for casting spells that use
    the <strong>Arrow</strong> gesture.</p><p>After performing a
    <strong>Strike</strong> with a projectile weapon, you may cast a spell using
    the <strong>Arrow</strong> gesture during the same Turn with Action Cost
    reduced by 1.</p>
