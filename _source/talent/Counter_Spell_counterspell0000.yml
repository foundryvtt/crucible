    <p>Counter-Spell mechanics are preliminary and not implemented in Playtest
    1. You may test the <em>intention</em> of this talent by working with your
    GM, but this process will not be refined or automated until a later Playtest
    phase.</p>

        You form arcane energy into a countervailing spellcraft. Designate a
        Rune and Gesture which you know to attempt to counter the spell. You
        must be able to hit your target with your chosen Gesture. Choosing a
        Rune which is opposed to the Rune being cast adds +3 Boons to your roll.
        Choosing the same Gesture as the one being cast adds +3 Boons to your
        roll. Perform an <strong>Opposed Test</strong> against the caster of the
        spell using the Ability, Skill, and Enchantment bonuses of the
        respective spells being cast. If your roll exceeds theirs, the spell is
        countered and its magic is nullified.
