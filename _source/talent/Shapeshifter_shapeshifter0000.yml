    <p>You possess supernatural ability to transform your body into the shapes
    of beasts.</p><p>You undergo a transformation where you assume the form of a
    beast that you are familiar with and which is half your level or less. While
    transformed you have the exact attributes and abilities of the chosen
    beast.</p><p>Your equipment is magically incorporated into the form that you
    take, however you gain no benefit from that equipment while
    transformed.</p><p>If your bestial form becomes Incapacitated you revert
    back to your normal form with any excess damage becoming Wounds. If your
    Morale is Broken while in beast form your transformation ends and any excess
    damage becomes Madness.</p>
