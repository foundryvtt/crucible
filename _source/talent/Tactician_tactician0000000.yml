        Using 10 words or fewer, describe a course of action to an ally who acts
        after you in Initiative order. If that ally carries out your described
        plan later in the same Round, they gain +2 Boons on any dice rolls
        associated with that plan. The Gamemaster may arbitrate whether or not
        the plan was followed.
