  description: >-
    <p>Infuse the essence of a Rune into the self, empowering your own physical
    form or psyche.</p>


    <p>When you assume a certain Aspect, you become more closely attuned to the
    damage type of the Rune used in your spell. You gain <strong>+2
    Resistance</strong> to that damage type, and deal an additional <strong>+2
    Damage</strong> whenever dealing damage of that type.</p>


    <p>Your Aspect lasts for <strong>6 Rounds</strong>. You may only have one
    active Aspect, casting another spell using the Aspect gesture replaces the
    previous effect.</p>
