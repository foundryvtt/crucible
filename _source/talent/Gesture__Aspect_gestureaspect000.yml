    <p>You infuse the essence of a Rune into your body, empowering your own
    physical form or psyche.</p><p>When you assume a certain Aspect, you become
    more closely attuned to the damage type of the Rune used in your spell. You
    gain <strong>+2 Resistance</strong> to that damage type, and deal an
    additional <strong>+2 Damage</strong> whenever dealing damage of that
    type.</p><p>Your Aspect lasts for <strong>6 Rounds</strong>. You may only
    have one active Aspect, casting another spell using the Aspect gesture
    replaces the previous effect. This gesture requires <strong>1 Hand</strong>
    to cast and has a base cost of <strong>2 Action</strong> and <strong>1
    Focus</strong>.</p>
