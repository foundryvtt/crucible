    <p>Intensify an arcane phenomenon at close range. Influence could be used
    with the Flame rune to set a target ablaze or with the Stasis rune to sap
    their Morale.</p>

    <p>The Influence gesture is a more powerful evolution of the basic Touch
    gesture that is learned with any Rune.</p>

    <p>The Influence gesture scales using <strong>Presence</strong> and targets
    a <strong>single</strong> adjacent creature, dealing 12 base damage on a
    successful attack.</p>
