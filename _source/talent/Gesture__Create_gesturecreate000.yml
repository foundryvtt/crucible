    <p>Coalesce arcane power into tangible form, conjuring a
    <strong>Sprite</strong> which appears within 10 feet and joins Combat at
    Initiative 1.</p><p>Your Sprite is a Minion of half your own Level chosen
    from the Summoned Creatures compendium pack corresponding to the Rune used
    in the spell.</p><p>The Sprite lasts for <strong>10 Rounds</strong>. You may
    only have one active Sprite, casting another spell using the Create gesture
    replaces your previous Sprite.</p><h3 class="divider">Important
    Note</h3><p>Not all Runes have a Sprite actor defined yet. Runes that do not
    yet have a defined Creation will — for now — manifest a <strong>Flame
    Sprite</strong>.</p>
