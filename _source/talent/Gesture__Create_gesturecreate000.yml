  description: >-
    <p>Coalesce arcane power into tangible form, conjuring a
    <strong>Mote</strong> which appears within 10 feet and joins Combat at
    Initiative 1.</p><p>Your Mote is a Minion of half your own Level chosen from
    the Summoned Creatures compendium pack corresponding to the Rune used in the
    spell.</p><p>The Mote lasts for <strong>10 Rounds</strong>. You may only
    have one active Mote, casting another spell using the Create gesture
    replaces your previous Mote.</p><h3 class="divider">Important
    Note</h3><p>Not all Runes have a Mote actor defined yet. Runes that do not
    yet have a defined Creation will — for now — manifest a <strong>Flame
    Mote</strong>.</p>
