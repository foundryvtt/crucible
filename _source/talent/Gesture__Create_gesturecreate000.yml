    <p>You coalesce arcane power into tangible form, manifesting a
    <strong>Sprite</strong> which appears within 10 feet and joins Combat at
    Initiative 1. Your Sprite is a <strong>Minion</strong> of half your own
    Level.</p><p>The Create gesture scales with <strong>Wisdom</strong> and the
    Sprite survives for <strong>6 Rounds</strong>. You may only have one active
    Sprite, casting another spell using the Create gesture replaces your
    previous Sprite. This gesture requires <strong>2 Hands</strong> to cast and
    has a base cost of <strong>4 Action</strong> and <strong>1
    Focus</strong>.</p><h3 class="divider">Playtest Notes</h3><p>Not all Runes
    have a Sprite actor defined yet. Runes that do not yet have a defined
    Creation will — for now — manifest a <strong>Flame Sprite</strong>.</p>
