    <p>You have a basic education in anatomy, physiology, and medicine. You gain
    the <strong>Novice</strong> rank in the <strong>Medicine </strong>skill and
    are no longer considered <strong>Untrained</strong> in that
    skill.</p><p>You’ve learned the basics of treating common wounds and
    illnesses, and keep a running list of known alchemical and herbal compounds
    that can be used for treating particular illnesses. With a little time
    studying an injured, diseased, or otherwise ill individual you can perform a
    basic diagnosis and treat accordingly.</p>
