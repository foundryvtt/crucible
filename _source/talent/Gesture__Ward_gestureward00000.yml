  description: >-
    <p>You shape the arcane power of a Rune into a protective barrier used to
    shield yourself from harm.</p><p>The Ward gesture scales using
    <strong>Toughness</strong> and provides <strong>+6 Resistance</strong>
    against the damage type of the Rune used in the spell. This resistance lasts
    for <strong>1 Round</strong> and you may only have a single Ward at a time.
    Casting another spell using the Ward gesture replaces your prior Ward. This
    gesture requires <strong>1 Hand</strong> to cast and has a base cost of
    <strong>2 Action</strong> and <strong>1 Focus</strong>.</p>
