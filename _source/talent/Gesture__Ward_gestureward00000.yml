  description: >-
    <p>Focus the power of a Rune into a protective barrier, shielding yourselves
    and others from harmful effects. When used with the Kinesis rune the Ward
    reduces incoming damage from a chosen physical damage type while combination
    with the Death rune protects against Corruption damage.</p>

    <p>Your Ward provides <strong>+6 Resistance</strong> against the damage type
    of the Rune used in the spell. The Ward lasts for 1 Round.</p>

    <p>You may only have a single Ward at a time. Casting another spell using
    the Ward gesture replaces your prior Ward.</p>
