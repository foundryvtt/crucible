  description: >-
    <p>You have received training in the basics of stealth, infiltration, and
    subterfuge. You gain the <strong>Novice</strong> rank in the <strong>Stealth
    </strong>skill and are no longer considered <strong>Untrained</strong> in
    that skill.</p><p>You know how to use light and shadow to mask your
    presence, to distribute your weight when walking in order to move more
    quietly, and you have learned a few tricks of disguise in order to blend
    into a crowd. You can appear unsuspicious when surrounded by others, hide in
    a darkened room, and can move silently enough to avoid detection by the
    average person.</p>
