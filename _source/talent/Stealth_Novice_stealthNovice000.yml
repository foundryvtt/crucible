    <p><span style="font-family:Vollkorn, serif">You have received training in
    the basics of stealth, infiltration, and subterfuge. You gain the
    <strong>Novice</strong> rank in the <strong>Stealth </strong>skill and are
    no longer considered <strong>Untrained</strong> in that
    skill.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Vollkorn, serif">You know how
    to use light and shadow to mask your presence, to distribute your weight
    when walking in order to move more quietly, and you have learned a few
    tricks of disguise in order to blend into a crowd. You can appear
    unsuspicious when surrounded by others, hide in a darkened room, and can
    move silently enough to avoid detection by the average person.</span></p>
