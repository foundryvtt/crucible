    <p>Wanderers are significant manifestations of elemental energy that assume
    a form that is imposing or majestic. They are self-aware, sapient, and
    understand that they unnatural interlopers when outside of their typical
    realm. They are often driven by some instinctive or premeditated purpose
    which has drawn them forth.</p>
